I made better progress on the MTA based Express or Local App by using the .txt files found in a related forum
post that the MTA didn't include in the initial .zip download. I also worked to include Browser Object and
Document Object model ideas into the Stats section of the Visit Monaco website.

I also have been working on the "qt Beginner Guide" that's provided by the official documentation for qt in
order to become more familiar with it so I can further help the Lubuntu team, and will include related examples
in the Programming Book Progress section of the site. I also have started the "C# 7.0 in a Nutshell" OReilly
book in hopes to possibly utilize the skills later for a related job at work. I also made further progress in
the "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" with more regex examples from Chapter 7.
