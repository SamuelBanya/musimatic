This week has been a bit long in many ways, so I was looking for more ways
to get back into doing digital art this weekend to just relax.

I still have that Loomis art book laying around so I might read that.

I found these two goldmines for art learning, both of which have a ton of
related links:

I didn't even know people replace drawing tablet nibs with weed wacker cable
snippets that are sanded afterwards. This thought alone blew my mind as I
just have a cheapo Huion tablet I bought a few years ago which works just
fine on Linux with Krita and Grafx2. I think the current digital pen's nib
is pretty used at this point, so I definitely am debating how to go about doing
this. Here's the specific 0.65" trimmer line that you can use to create your
own DIY replacement nibs for digital drawing pens:

I watched so many Adrian Belew based videos this week, so I've been pretty
inspired to just keep doing music on the side. The guy's a genius in my
opinion. Some of the old King Crimson 80's stuff is just mindblowing,
especially their 80's tour videos with the weird looping segments between songs.
Such cool stuff. Clips like that always make me want to get a Digitech JamMan
Stereo from eBay to do some cool music loops.

Here's some King Crimson 80's vids at their peak, just great stuff:

I plan on possibly taking down my Bandcamp and Soundcloud pages, and just
re-hosting it on this site. However, I will have to find a nice streamable
media player that runs on a page. If that exists (which it probably does),
then I'll be set, and depend on one less platform, which is always a good thing.

I might also however have a Donate button at the top of the related music in
case the bandwidth caps out though ;).

I found some good ways to self-host audio streaming on my own site:

-   <http://opentape.fm/>
-   <http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/>
-   <https://nunzioweb.com/streaming_audio-example.htm>

On that "nunzioweb.com" site, I noticed how on this page, he was able to change
the CSS stylesheet on the fly, which is EXACTLY what I wanted to do. Time
to somehow copy his "setActiveStylesheet()" JS function ^_^

-   <https://nunzioweb.com/index.shtml#top>

After careful examination of that page's "Network" tab, I believe I found the
source of the magical JS script that changes the stylesheet on the fly. I
definitely am debating how I can adapt this to my site, very cool:

-   <https://nunzioweb.com/js/switchcontent2.js>

Other than that, I'm doing some cleanup on the "Programming" page and am
thinking more about the small React JS app I want to do to pull down
Yahoo! Finance stock data. I've been trying to get some of the older projects
running again, and realized that a lot of them would have been better suited
towards running them using 'venv' in a virtual environment to prevent having
to pull in Python 3 library dependencies for cron jobs.

Maybe I'll look into running a BBS or hosting an IRC server on this site, who
knows.

Just gonna chill out as far as I know though :).

Hope everyone is doing well.
