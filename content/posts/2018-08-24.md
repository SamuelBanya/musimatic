I have been updating the Monaco website to include more scripts on the stats page. I am also becoming
more active in Open Source projects such as BeeWare, and am working on running test scripts for this
great open source project. I am also working on finishing the Hockey Webscraper to include an FTP link
via the Twitter post that will be hosted from the webhosting provider's FTP service via Python's "ftplib"
module, and using urllib3. I'm also going to be fixing the switches on my Line 6 PodHD500 multi-fx pedal
this weekend, and will post related pics of the completed project.
