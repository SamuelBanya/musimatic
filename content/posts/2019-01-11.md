I have begun the new year with quite a few changes to note. I was unfortunately sick for the
last two weeks, but began an awesome new job doing customer support for a software firm.
I plan on sharing my adventures in learning automation tools like Selenium, and PowerShell,
in order to automate some of the boring or repetitive tasks regarding customer tickets in
ZenDesk, and JIRA.

I finally have the Hockey Webscraper up and running after getting the FTP side of things
resolved with the web hosting site and am trying my best to still work on finishing the
MTA based Express or Local App. I also worked on the Jim Davis based
fan website as well.

I am actively working on improving the overall feel of this webpage to be more like WordPress
in design, but still am adamant on using my own CSS styling, alongside Bootstrap.

I will use this site as an educational tool in articles that I will call "SuperUser Sam" in
which I write about programming, automation, Linux utilities, Raspberry Pi, etc. I am really
looking forward to this, and hope you will join me in my love to make everyone's lives a
little bit easier with the use of computers.
