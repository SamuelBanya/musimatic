I've had a pretty easy going week at work this week, which led me to finish a
lot of work projects in the next few weeks ahead of time in terms of a week
off of vacation.

That being noted, I've also made strides to really see if I can attempt to
tap into ZenDesk. I've come across a few barriers including the fact that
I don't have access to the ZenDesk API for work. However, I'm working
around this by utilizing Selenium with Python 3 in an effort to convert
a list of tickets and import them into an Org mode document so that I would
automatically have a todo list of recently updated tickets.

This would help my workflow, and might help others in my situation in which
the API access is limited to someone's ZenDesk account. Also, I use Org-Mode
quite a lot with TODO lists at work, so incorporating the current status
of tickets into my workflow would be awesome. Even possibly having the ability
to respond to tickets without even having to log into ZenDesk sounds awesome.
I can probably achieve this with Selenium through either ZenDesk or my work
email, so either of these two solutions will help me achieve my goal in that
regards.

I have been learning more about the w3m browser, which is a super cool terminal
based web browser. Using it with the w3m-img add-on is a must though as this
allows you to display images while surfing the web in your terminal.

I also recommend using a terminal like urxvt or x-term which supports w3m-img.

More info. on w3m can be found here:

I've been playing quite a few ZX Spectrum games, and got X128, a DOS based
pemulator for the ZX Spectrum to work just fine. However, I can't seem to
figure out why mapping keys is so hard for that emulator. I also installed
the FUSE emulator through apt so we'll see if that's better in the long run.
