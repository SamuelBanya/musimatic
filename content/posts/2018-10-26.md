I updated the "Visit Monaco" website with more JS based scripts, and also included more of my Python
Chapter 7 examples in the Programming Books Progress website progress page. The MTA app is turning out
to be more or less a database SQL app. I also posted C# examples from the OReilly "C# 7.0 in a Nutshell"
book in order to learn it to possibly use the skills to apply for a related job in the Dev department at work.
