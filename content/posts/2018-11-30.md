I posted on the MTA related Google+ group forum to ask how to hone in on the specific 7 NYC Train
data. I also switched my focus on the Bull or Bear Webscraper C# app to try to scrape the CNBC website,
and then switched the focus back to trying to utilize the Bloomberg C# API since they DO provide examples
within the same download, and its worth a shot. I updated the Python and C# sections with new examples
from Chapter 7 and Chapter 2 respectively. I also uploaded all of my progress to my GitHub repository
called "scripts", and will upload my C++ progress as Repl.it files as well to be posted on the Programming
Projects section as well.
