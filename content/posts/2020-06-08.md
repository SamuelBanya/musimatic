I completely removed my GitHub account as I want nothing to do with
Microsoft going forward.

I think GitHub isn't that great of a service and feel that I do better
off with hosting my own projects as just .git directories on my own
web page.

If anyone is really that interested in obtaining a repo for their own
use, then they could just 'wget' the contents of the page and be done
with it.

Pretty happy about this move though.

Now I just have to move all of my personal project repos to their
own git instances on the public facing portion of my website, and
we'll be good.

One step closer without any dependence upon Microsoft. Today is a
good day.

Now to think about how to do this on the work computer to run Linux
instead ;) and maybe even LegacyOS to match, ha! That'll be the day.

A day... coming soon :)
