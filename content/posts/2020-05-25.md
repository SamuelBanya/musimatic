I was able to refine the "Outlook Terminal Client" project further,
and am pretty much almost done with it.

The only tasks left to work on for this project include:

-   Allow user to re-select the already chosen date if they

would like to

-   Allow user to select a date before 2020. For whatever reason, it

doesn't allow the user to do this, so this might be an limitation /
issue with imap.search() function with the 'SINCE' option.

-   Allow user to search for email in mailboxes OTHER than their

'INBOX' folder. Users like myself have heavily filtered folders for
their Outlook email, so it would make sense to allow them to select
from an integer picklist to do so.

Latest project progress can be found here:

I learned a few things in C which was cool.

Also, had some great food today for Memorial Day and got QTox working.

QTox is a super cool video calling program that runs on most platforms
(Windows, Linux, Mac).

I would recommend QTox for anyone interested in Zoom alternatives:

Jitsi Meet was pretty promising for any smartphone users:

Hope everyone has a great week :) God Bless
