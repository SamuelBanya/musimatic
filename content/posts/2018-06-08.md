Updated overall website design, looks good so far. Still trying to make the Song Of The Day Webscraper actually
work on its iFrame webpage. Cat Of The Day Webscraper still works, and I'm making progress on the Hockey Webscraper.
I might shift focus to purely implementing the MIDI to Audio conversion for the Song Of The Day Webscraper though.
