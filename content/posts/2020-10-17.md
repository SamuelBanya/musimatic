Today was a great day.

I finally did it.

I finally installed Gentoo in a VM.

It took three separate attempts over two weekend sessions but I got it booted
thankfully. I plan on figuring out how to maybe get Emacs Window Manager present in that
particular VM as well, so that's gonna be a cool project indeed. Otherwise, my
related installation guide is now pretty complete, so I could easily do it again
in less than an hour if I needed to.

I also got my old-as-heck ExpressOrLocalApp project back up and running, which is
semi-hilarious because I doubt anyone actualy still uses the 7 Train in NYC anymore.
But hey, its updated every minute for anyone who wants this data. I had to re-adjust
a few things as the MTA changed their data feed to be more API key specific, so it
was a bit of a pain of trying to read their recent post in the related MTA Data
Google Group post on the API Key change.

However, I had enough ingenuity to figure out how to change the "headers" section
for the requests.get() function call, and baby, we are LIVE again! :D

I've been trying to wrap my head around placing my Emacs configuration file into
an Org Mode document since I found out about "Hydra" and "Helm" within Emacs,
and just felt the need to figure out how to finally configure Emacs since I've
been using it for quite some time now.

Some really good references on this topic include these links:

-   <https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/3143/can-i-use-org-mode-to-structure-my-emacs-or-other-el-configuration-file>

Also, in this same burst of research, I found another guy just like myself who literally
blogs on his site using Emacs Org Mode in one giant org doc:

I also found this really cool Linux reference link page from a guy on IRC, which is neat
and very organized:

-   <https://www.msiism.org/links.html>

Also, through that same guy's site, I found other really really useful Linux reference links
for Linux based audio programs as well:

-   <http://linux-sound.org/>
-   <http://linuxsynths.com/>

I found this really useful comprehensive list site on Window Managers as well:

-   <https://www.gilesorr.com/wm/table.html>

This part of his page lists window managers based on the programming languge they're based in,
which is super helpful in deciding what window manager to use, since if you can better understand
the config file, you can easily modify yourself:

This same guy's list of helpful Linux utilities is awesome too:

-   <https://www.gilesorr.com/wm/helpers.html>

On a total side note, I found these pretty hilarious Geocities looking sites,
which I might copy in terms of style when I re-design the site later this year:

Keep having fun :)
