I looked into FreeBSD, and wow, I am impressed. It pretty much can run most
Linux software in its own compatibility layer. This includes window managers,
and other key things I use on a daily basis.

Here's some great vids on the topic of using FreeBSD as a Desktop-centered
OS:

I think I might even swap out my go-to Devuan setup for just a FreeBSD setup
to run Linux based VM's though I'll have to try out FreeBSD in a VM first.
Also, I'll probably get into this if I get bored of my Gentoo install as well.

I saw this website randomly, and I really like how he has his web apps setup,
so I might steal this kind of design for the "Apps" section of all my web
app projects for the re-design of this site:

I found out about that previous site because that same person is the one that
re-designed the Org Mode website, which looks awesome by the way, and WAY better
than the previous site:

-   <https://orgmode.org/index.html>

Found out about "Binder mode", and this looks awesome as well. Definitely would
try this in terms of binding together several free-flowing idea type notes.
Would be great in the context of songwriting lyrics, etc.:

I bought a used NUX Solid Studio pedal the other day, so I'm looking forward
to using it on the album I've been working on.

I've been debating a keyboard amp or guitar amp setup, and I think this would
be a great alternative for the time being, as I primarily just record music
and play music at home anyway. I can finally use the amp-in-a-box type
pedal I've had laying around, and put it right in front of the NUX Solid Studio,
and then use an existing multi-fx pedal I have for the effects section.

I also plan on slowly building a pedalboard from some of my existing pedals, but
also a separate one dedicated to loops and effects.

I cheaped out a while ago, and got two Ikea Hejne shelves for like around $10,
and voilah, two full size pedalboards. Just have to get some more velcro tape
and I'm set. It's hilarious how much money you can save on things like this,
as the metal variants are about $60 to $100 more, especially if we're talking
about the Pedaltrain Pro type pedalboards.

I learned about this trick from this vid, so I would check it out if you're
interested in creating a pedalboard on the cheap:

More and more, I've decided that instead of potentially building or buying
a cheapo or used guitar, I'll just mess around with my existing Tele clone
guitar. I will most likely have to buy a soldering iron later on, but I think
this would be my entry point into electronics and instrument building to
be honest. I will most likely swap out the neck pickup, and the underlying
electronics as I'm interested in the GFS Kwikplug system to easily swap
out pickups on the fly.

I think the idea of getting more pedals is because I've been watching more
and more guitar pedal demo videos just to relax. This channel in particular
is pretty awesome on this topic:

Some of these guitar pedal designs are so beautiful and inspiring. I honestly
wish I could make some to demo out and have some fun with, and somehow make
them interact with the internet in weird ways.

I've been also on the hunt for more VSTs or plugins to use in Reaper. I found
this one to be a pretty cool one, as it emulates the Super Nintendo's
Yamaha SPC700 sound chip. I'll see if it'll play nicely in Carla on Linux
based Reaper. Worth a shot though:

A really good reference on the SPC700 soundchip, as well as related Super
Nintendo music is this site. Definitely worth checking out for the simple
site design alone:

Here's to still having fun making music.
