I am planning to do a re-design in early 2020 for this site to be more minimalistic
in design as I think the style attempt is good, but it could be a bit simpler, and
be based on more templated designs. I'll figure out how to do this using either
purely templates, or purely JS.

I am really looking forward to working on the Bandcamper project soon. This project's
GitHub page can be found here:

-   <https://github.com/SBanya/Bandcamper>

The goal of this project is to perform the following actions:

-   Scrape the Bandcamp tags page for the latest geographical tags (ex: US states) and genres
-   Display a webpage to the user to prompt them to ask what genre or geographical state they'd be interested in terms of exploring bands from via a related email.
-   Provide the user with the email at 6 AM every day to make the program static and not dependent on being a web app.
-   Provide the user with the ability to opt out of an email every time.
-   Limit messages per email to about 10 to prevent spam.
-   Provide a user with a script that uses Youtube-dl Linux utility that automatically downloads these Bandcamp music for users.
