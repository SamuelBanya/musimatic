I've been working on utilizing a few links to get the "ISS Location Receiver" project underway, which can be
observed in the "ISS Station Location" section on this page:

-   <https://musimatic.net/radio.html>

I've been utilizing the following links to do so:

-   <http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/>
-   <https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/>
-   <https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.7.1.html#map-options>
-   <https://asmaloney.com/2014/01/code/creating-an-interactive-map-with-leaflet-and-openstreetmap/>
-   <https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames#Tile_servers>
-   <https://openmaptiles.org/>
-   <https://mledoze.github.io/countries/>

Still deciding on how to best do this as you can easily just have it run every five seconds with
a "setTimeout()" JS function.

Also, I would like to do this via an AJAX request via a button too if possible which would be cool.

We'll see.

Otherwise, still looking for a $200 mid-tier Ham Radio since I'll be able to get a free J-Pole antenna
and power supply from two different Ham's in the area. Looking for one that can be easily programmed with
CHIRP software, but can reach repeaters in the area.

I think I'll keep myself occupied with Echolink via QTel for the time being though while I keep doing my related
research.

Also, I'm looking into VoIP based services to make internet calls with cordless or corded old-school phones, since
I pretty much am fed up with using cellphones these days.

Some VoIP software I found that works on Linux:

-   <https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble>
-   <https://qtox.github.io/>
-   <https://jami.net/download-jami-linux/>

Keep staying positive :)
