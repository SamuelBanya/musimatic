I finished applying Chapter 3 of the "Javascript &amp; JQuery" book to the "Visit Monaco" website. I plan on
modifying the content by adding additional CSS styling changes next week. I only made small progress for
Python and C# due to working overtime to leave early for the Thanksgiving holiday next week. The current
issue with the Python based MTA Express or Local App is the looping section for each of the train properties.

I've also decided to get this only working for the 7 Train since Amazon announced its 2nd HQ as Long Island
City, Queens, so its only applicable to track the 7 train's data for this reason. The C# based Bloomberg
Bull or Bear Webscraper is having issues since I was able to scrape the page using the older "WebClient" C#
library, but Bloomberg detected my scraper. This means I'll have to access their data via an API instead,
and hopefully this will be easy in C#.
