I've been trying to figure out how to fix the "ftplib" Python module issue, and have been sending e-mails
back and forth to the web hosting company to figure out the exact FTP directory I need to upload a link
for the Hockey Webscraper. I've also ran a test suite for the Pybee open source project, and am going to
run more specific tests for the project next week. I received the switches in the mail for the PODHD500
guitar pedal, so I'll post pics of how I fix it by soldering new switches within the next two weeks
during a weekend. I also updated the Visit Monaco website with new scripts to include object orientated
JavaScript programming as well.
