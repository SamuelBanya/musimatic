I've been in some rough shape with my back health for the past two weeks.

This means I haven't been able to work on much art, or even the synth album I was working on a bit. Kind of sucks, but that's how life is sometimes. Can't say I didn't think of great ideas in the meantime and similar webpages to copy entire styles from though.

That being said, I did some major overhauling with the two websites I run.

I moved all of my art and music to my art portfolio website:

-   <https://www.sambanya.com>

I then overhauled this site to only feature web dev type projects going forward so I can present a decent portfolio going forward:

-   <https://www.musimatic.xyz>

I also put embedded music players from Bandcamp and Soundcloud on the music section of my main page:

-   <https://www.sambanya.com/music.html>

Overall, I probably still need to play around with the button layouts a bit more, but its good for what it is, since I literally only manage the webpages with Org docs in Emacs, and export them into HTML which makes editing them a breeze.

My goal going forward is to make the 'Web Apps' page resemble something like one of the following websites:

-   <https://aem1k.com/>
-   <http://jankenpopp.com/>

To think, my old website for that original solo band, "The Bedside Morale", was never actually put up on the internet, but only was going to run on an Apache webserver back in 2011 or so. I have it archived somewhere on my file server. Should dig it up and host it for fun since the glossy buttons were beautiful for hte time being. On a similar note, it is absolutely crazy how easier things have become to deploy servers with since the average person could deploy even a Wordpress website in seconds without even needing to know a single line of PHP (unheard of back then).

Looking forward to deploying some real web apps with React, Django, etc. when I actually get better though. Probably will just stick with the Typescript course I was working on to completion, and then go straight for another Full Stack type course to tag along with related projects.

Here's to a better web development portfolio and a better career for the future.
