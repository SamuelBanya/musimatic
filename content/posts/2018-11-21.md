I was only able to work on Python this week, but made a bit more progress on the MTA Express or Local App,
since I cleaned up a lot of the code into separate functions. The biggest issue I'm facing is trying to
make the data only look into the 7 Train, by indexing into feed.entity with a specific value. I've been
trying to just brute force it and see which value works, but I might be better off actually looking into
some of the .txt files provided by the MTA. I also finished the Visit Monaco website, but am trying to
fix the styling of various HTML elements throughout the pages present.
