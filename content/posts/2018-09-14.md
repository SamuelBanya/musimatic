I completed the Hockey Webscraper project, and it now runs at 1 PM every day on my Twitter account. I am now
working on an MTA related Python app called "Express Or Local" that displays express or local train time,
and will display user configured route settings. I also have been working on adding more JavaScript scripts
to the "Visit Monaco" website.
