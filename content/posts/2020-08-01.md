I have been in the process of trying to deploy a 'Searx' instance on this site, but so far, I
haven't made much progress and am kind of stuck on why its always stating "Rate limit exceeded"
when you attempt to visit the Searx instance via the 'curl' Linux terminal command.

I've been trying to utilize this part of the Searx official documentation guide and a related
GitHub issue that has a very close nginx based configuration for the 'searx' site but haven't really
figured out the root cause of the issue as I've followed each of the installation steps VERY closely:

-   <https://asciimoo.github.io/searx/admin/installation-nginx.html>
-   <https://github.com/dalf/searx-instances/issues/68#issuecomment-659293546>

Only other thing I noted this weekend is that "invidio.us" looks like its going to taken down in September 2020,
which sucks because I try to access YouTube through that instance to pull down videos for later viewing so that
I don't get a million tracked ads while on YouTube.

It is 10x better to watch content locally on your computer than having to stream and potentially deal with ads and
the like. Also, watching videos locally with 'mpv' is amazing. I just hope someone forks the "Invidio" project here,
and keeps it going so that I can keep checking out content on YouTube with a minimal browser like w3m:

There are other public instances of "Invidious", but who knows how long these will last if the main project
will end in September:

Will post details if I actually get 'searx' up and running though, as I'm looking forward to it.
