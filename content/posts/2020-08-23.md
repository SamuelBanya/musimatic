I did a very big move recently, and we just got all of our stuff settled into the new place.

It's been great so far, and pretty laid back comparatively.

However, its been a lot of ups and downs regarding how to rent a house, so I can't say its been too
easy, but I've been grateful that we made it in one piece and are closer to family given these
crazy times.

After a few weeks of just chilling out after work so I don't burn out, I realized my efforts in terms
of learning any tech stuff on the side should be focused on what I can apply directly into actual projects.

For example, instead of doing the related JS book from start to finish, I think I just need to read through
a related chapter, see what's applicable, and make a part of this actual site that features that capability instead
of working on silly fake websites that would be used as part of some "portfolio" or something.

Even as far as portfolio websites are concerned, I'm pretty sure if you can deploy a Wordpress site, you're
pretty much close to doing anything similar, so I might actually devote some time deploying some small
tinkering Wordpress (WP) sites in that case to gain that skill.

As far as the work based ElectronJS app I've been working on, I plan on just following some YouTube tutorials,
see what sticks, and just apply it to the app itself as its not rocket science.

I've been also working on getting my ham radio license, and figuring out what I'd like to do with the yard gardening
wise since I do have a garage to get some projects done now.

Also, I'm posting some useful Emacs based Org Mode shortcuts for anyone who does finances like myself in Org Mode as well:

```bash
C-x-h: Select everything on screen
C-c-|: Turn the entire Org document into an Org-Mode table
C-c-}: Turn on row and column numbers to make formulas easier in Org-Mode
M-S-Left: Delete a column
C-c-^: Sort a column based on the provided choices (Note: Do this in the Date column based cell for an easy date sort)
```

Other plans for this site:

| Idea                                          | Description                                                                                                            |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Deploy Searx Instance                         | Search engine without the ad tracking, and to be used among people I know / better alternative to Google or DuckDuckGo |
| Useful Ham Radio Utility Webpages             | Maybe could scrape some useful frequencies, NOAA weather, etc                                                          |
| Radio (FM, AM, etc)                           | Could be a fun little side page                                                                                        |
| Change the CSS stylesheet for the "Blog" page | Solarized theme is kinda looking OK at best, could be better                                                           |
| Deploy UnrealIRCd IRC Server                  | Would be a great private IRC instance for family and friend use                                                        |

Staying positive, God Bless.
