I did some changes throughout both of my live sites.

Here are the changes I did for the 'musimatic.xyz' tech portfolio site:

-   I changed the styling of this page since I'm gearing this to be more and more of a tech resume / portfolio website.
-   I revised the main CSS stylesheet so that the button transitions are nice to show off the effects I have done.
-   I also added some ASCII art as the title, which really fits the vibe of the site.
-   I revised the webring so that there is a link at the bottom that takes you to the top of the page if needed since webrings always contain a ton of links, and this helps with the discovery of new sites to explore from a new user's perspective

Here are the changes I did for the 'sambanya.com' art portfolio site:

-   I modified the 'ArtGalleryCreator2' project so that the sorted() function present uses the 'reverse=True' parameter value so that the latest scanned artwork is displayed first.
-   I made great strides to the 'Portfolio' section to align it with David Revoy's site's CSS stylesheet as I really like the way he did the layout for an artist site like his (though I will modify it later on to be truly my own in terms of color schemes present):
-   <https://www.davidrevoy.com/>

A huge note to point out that such a revision for the 'Portfolio' section of the art site, 'sambanya.com' is a giant undertaking to do, so it's not complete by any means. This will require me to create a 'PortfolioSiteCreator' project, similar to the 'ArtGalleryCreator2' project because this will need to have thumbnails automatically created for each image that I dump into a 'portfolio' image folder. This is so I don't have to manually revise this site each and every time, and like a good developer, just automate the boring stuff so you can focus on the fun things.

The 'flexbox' JS library portion of the issue is easy to implement. It's just making sure that the resulting HTML template is repeatable and scalable is a different story. However, I don't think it will take much time, but its not that big of a deal yet, so I am in no rush to complete this.

I did create an Instagram account for my artwork as well under the name of 'ShortstopGFX', but haven't uploaded anything yet, as I am deciding 'the best of the best' of everything I've done so far to post on there:

-   <https://www.instagram.com/shortstopgfx/>

It mostly will be filled with pen and ink drawings, as well as pixel art that I post to scene demo parties on 'Pouet' (<https://www.pouet.net/>) most likely.

For the uninitiated, I plan on following in the footsteps of 'ProwlerGFX', since I want to do his style of pixel art later on, but I still know that it will still take time to reach this level of artwork:
