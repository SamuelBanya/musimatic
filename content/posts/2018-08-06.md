I updated the Cat Of The Day Twitter Webscraper Bot to actually run at 1 pm every day! This took several
attempts since the urllib module is very specific on how its methods are called. I am currently working on
adding more features to the Monaco website, and am also working on making a menu webscraper Twitter bot that
will actively scrape a Brooklyn based restaurant's PDF menu. I'm waiting for Twitter to approve this bot's
account, but should be working soon.
