I've been working on the Visit Monaco website, and to update the Hockey Webscraper to be placed on
Twitter. The only issue at the moment is to account for Python's FTP module, and with the shared hosting
server that this website is on. Once that is included, I can finally include Twitter posts with Excel
.xlsx file attachments for the Hockey Webscraper. I also have been working on different Automating The
Boring Stuff chapter projects which I will upload at a later time.
