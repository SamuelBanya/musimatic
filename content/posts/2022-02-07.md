I am still debating the exact CSS stylesheet to use for the main art portfolio website:

-   <https://www.sambanya.com/>

I am still leaning heavily towards copying the style of these three sites somehow:

-   <https://karlkopinski.com/>
-   <https://wyliebeckert.com/>
-   <https://davidmattingly.com/sketches/>

I found this site to be useful for studying posing figures since Blender makes my old Thinkpad X230 become a furnace, so this is a nice browser based alternative:

-   <https://www.posemaniacs.com/>

I also got lucky and found a YouTube channel that actually interviews a lot of the awesome 1970's sci-fi artists which is great since their workflow is so elusive even after heavy research.

Here are some cool highlights of videos I found:

-   Artist Depiction by Steve R Dodd:
-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wePM-O-ayKg>
-   Artist Depiction by Rick Guidice:
-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqgXo0KmgCw>
-   Closer Than We Think | Complete Syd Mead Interview | Retrofuturism:
-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvewl5Tlphc>

For fun, just check out Syd Mead's art to see some cool retro futurism:
