I updated the Visit Monaco website's stats sections with more arrays and object orientated programming ideas.
I also have been making progress on the Express or Local App by displaying information about the first train
in the dataset every 5 seconds in console. I hope to soon demystify the route id's and stop id's to make it
clear where the current train actually is in relation to an actual NYC subway stop. I also did my first
commit to Lubuntu's development, which can be found here:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;<https://phab.lubuntu.me/D23>&lt;/li&gt;
