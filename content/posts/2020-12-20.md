I had to create a throwaway email to post a GitHub issue, as I can't stand Microsoft anymore, let alone GitHub. Yet, like all similar services, you NEED to have an
account to raise an issue on some random GitHub project, so I had to figure out a way around this.

Luckily, there are some sites to easily make throwaway email accounts that get destroyed in 10 minutes or so, so here they are for a scenario like this:

-   <https://10minutemail.com/>
-   <https://mailnesia.com/>

There is another mail provider that provides you with basic free-tier email. Its doesn't last only 10 minutes, so this is a bit of an exception, but is better than
having to be forced to create a Gmail account which eventually forces you to use two-factor authentication via your private phone number, which they have no right
to obtain. This is the better alternative (for now):

-   <https://protonmail.com/>

I've assembled quite a list of sites to add to a 'Links' or 'WebRing' section to this site in the Geocities-style revision that will be released early next year.

Still debating if I should nuke the old variants of the site and just post screenshots of the design instead, as I wanted to use as little JS as possible going forward.

Here's To Throwaway Email Accounts And Cool 'Links' Sections :)
