This is the Welcome Center I have been developing for the past several months with the use of C++,
as well as the Qt framework.

Thankfully, it is now a fully functional one window application that is meant to help guide a
new user of Lubuntu of what to do after installing the operating system.

Features of the Welcome Center

-   Open The Lubuntu Manual Webpage
-   Configure Monitor Settings (Resolution)
-   Open LXQt Configuration Center To Further Adjust Entire OS Setup
-   Open Lubuntu Community Links Webpage To Get Help Through IRC, Telegram, And Mailing Lists
-   Open Up Contribution Guide To Find Out How To Help Contribute Work Towards Lubuntu
