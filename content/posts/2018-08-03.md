I finally uploaded the results of the Hockey Webscraper, and am actively working on the fake website, "Visit
Monaco, The Second Smallest Country In The World". I am also working on creating a "QC Auditor View" JavaScript
project for work to help me and my fellow Quality team members while auditing our website to redisplay Ad ID's,
and links to internal tools directly on each ad.
