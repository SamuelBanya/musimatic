I was able to utilize a few Crontab commands to update the weather part of the page.

Crontab based 'wget' commands are as follows:

```bash
*/5 * * * * wget -O /var/www/musimatic/images/newyorkweather.png wttr.in/newyork.png
*/5 * * * * wget -O /var/www/musimatic/images/nashvilleweather.png wttr.in/nashville.png
*/5 * * * * wget -O /var/www/musimatic/images/scrantonweather.png wttr.in/scranton.png
*/5 * * * * wget -O /var/www/musimatic/images/poincianaweather.png wttr.in/poinciana.png
*/5 * * * * wget -O /var/www/musimatic/images/newyorkweather.gif https://radar.weather.gov/lite/N0R/OKX_loop.gif
*/5 * * * * wget -O /var/www/musimatic/images/nashvilleweather.gif https://radar.weather.gov/lite/N0R/OHX_loop.gif
*/5 * * * * wget -O /var/www/musimatic/images/scrantonweather.gif https://radar.weather.gov/lite/N0R/BGM_loop.gif
*/5 * * * * wget -O /var/www/musimatic/images/poincianaweather.gif https://radar.weather.gov/lite/N0R/TBW_loop.gif
```

The end result can be found here:

If you ever want to find a specific area's weather from the National Weather Service's Apache server, you'll have to dig a bit yourself here:

If you ever want to bookmark a specific section from the 'Weather' page, you can use one of the following links as they take advantage of the "#"
id element values of the specific locations within the links themselves:
