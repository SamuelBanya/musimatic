Took a few months, but I'm happy to have released that JeeveSobs album called "Jagged Edges" today, which can be found here:

-   <https://jeevesobs.bandcamp.com/album/jagged-edges>

Pretty happy with the results.

Second album has been worked on for a while, and is more drum and loop focused which should be cool too.

Stay tuned.
