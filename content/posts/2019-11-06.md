I finally got the Gifs page to work with the necessary file permissions, so
go check it out. These are the gifs I've made for the past few years using
a few apps on an old Samsung Galaxy S6 phone I've had. Definitely would like
to continue making art in this style with the use of the program, GIMP, alongside
some scripts to help automate it as creating gifs can be a tedious but fun process.

The Gifs webpage can be found here:
