I am making progress on the Hockey Webscraper, but haven't posted the results yet. I created another fake
website called "The History Of MS Paint" to demonstrate my skills learned from Chapters 1 &amp; 2 for the HTML &amp; JS
books so far. I look forward to doing more project work before continuing in the actual books so that I can
reinforce and demonstrate what I've learned so far.
