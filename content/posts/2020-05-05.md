I am happy to note that I have successfully created the Scripture Of The Day project.

My resulting output webpage from this project can be found here:
<http://www.musimatic.net/pythonprojectwebsites/ScriptureOfTheDay/output.html>

Basically, this takes a random verse from the King James Version of the Bible
using the 'kjv' terminal program, which can be found here and built from
source:
<https://github.com/bontibon/kjv>

It is updated daily via a cronjob.

Very happy to have been able to complete this successfully.

Looking forward to continuing progress in my other project, "OutlookTerminalClient",
as I wanted to make a project to easily display current emails from Outlook.

After that, I will continue to explore other programs that morph Python 3
and JS based web frameworks to create interested web applications.

Also, I want to explore more terminal based applications to minmize the
amount of bloat on my system.

I am also debating what should be my long-term email application to use, and
am debating between the following options:

| Email Terminal Program Name | Pros                            | Cons                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| mu / mu4e (mu for emacs)    | Seems light-weight              | No 'ncurses' interface                                                                   |
| alpine                      | Seems easy to use               | None that I can see so far                                                               |
| OfflineIMAP                 | Stores emails on local computer | I'm a bit hesitant to store emails locally, but most Linux enthusiasts prefer this route |
