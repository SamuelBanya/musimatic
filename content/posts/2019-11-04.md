In case you ever need to indent an entire webpage (just like this one!) in Emacs,
you can actually select all of the code present with:

```emacs-lisp
C-x-f (Ctrl+x+f): This allows you to select all lines of code present in a file.
```

You can then finally then indent everything with:

```emacs-lisp
C-M-\ (Ctrl + Alt + \ 'backslash'): This indents all lines of code accordingly.
```

I found out this trick the other day, and it helped so much especially on a site like this
when I use multiple programming languages like Python 3 vs. JS vs HTML+CSS. By letting Emacs
do the work to beautify the code, it makes the process of creating projects that much easier.
