I have been helping triaging a few bugs for Emacs Org Mode on the weekends, and honestly, its been kind of fun. I was able to reproduce a few personally, and am aiming to figure out how to fix them along with the help of the existing maintainer named Ihor.

He's been super helpful to a newbie like myself, and is a complete wizard when it comes to his own Emacs workflow. Seeing him be able to handle his emails all within Emacs by using 'notmuch' was pretty awesome to see, and makes me want to do the same as well one of these days if I can figure out how to make it work with Fastmail.

Anyway, here's to contributing to one of the greatest modes that Emacs ever has created (Org Mode), and to the best editor of all time (Emacs). I literally would not have been able to handle my last 3 jobs if it weren't for both of these two tools alone since Vim and Obsidian don't even come close to the power of Emacs and Org Mode.
