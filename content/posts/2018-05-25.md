Updated background color to light purple on all webpages. Fixed Python script for Cat Of The Day Webscraper.
Still working on making Song Of The Day Webscraper functional without use of MIDI, and currently researching MIDI
to WAV converters to allow the user to play it in browser. Will also update guitar section with actual step by step
process on how I will fix my Fender Jaguar guitar's input jack with soldering since it's my first time doing so.
Wish me luck!
