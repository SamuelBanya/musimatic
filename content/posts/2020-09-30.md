After a lot of effort during lunch breaks at work, I was able to finally fix
the issues with the "ISS Location Receiver" project on this page:

I have to thank this blog post since it basically did the same idea, but their
project is a little bit more refined and polished:

I found a Budapest, Hungary based SDR to check out for anyone interested in Hungarian Ham Radio:

-   <http://pet.no-ip.biz:5050/>

I've been trying multiple Hungarian based Echolink repeaters, but can't seem to
get a QSO with any Hungarian Ham Radio Operators yet unfortunately.

It must be a timezone thing, or maybe Echolink just isn't as popular in Europe.

I've been debating getting a DMR based radio with a PiStar node (either my
existing Raspberry Pi 3, or get a Raspberry Pi Zero later).

The idea is that you can hook up a DMR radio to a Pi-Star hotspot, and then
connect with radio towers across the world, much like Echolink, but with
an actual radio instead of a headset, which is pretty dang neat.

I can't say I have the $200 or so to even do this setup right now unfortunately due to just
making enough right now to pay the bills, however, it something to consider down the line.

I bought a breadboard for electronics based stuff, but forgot to get a related battery for it, GO FIGURE ha!

Also, I've checked out a few BBS's by using the 'telnet' command, super cool stuff:

Anyway, keeping my mind occupied with the site, and happy I still have it. I'll keep thinking of cool sections to add,
and also the grand ol' re-design I've done every year. This year, I plan on doing a Geocities themed makeover, so it's
gonna be rad.

I found out how to use 'mpv' to display videos in a terminal using the following
command:
mpv --vo=caca (name of video)

It'll look like something similar to this, but you can least view videos on
lower-spec computers in terminal without a problem:

Makes me want to start a "TTY" or "X-less" based blog where I just PURELY use
terminal based programs, and don't rarely boot into X. Now THAT sounds like fun
^_^.

Keep having fun :)
