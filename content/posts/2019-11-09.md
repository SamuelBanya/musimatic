Here's a pretty useful command if you'd like to search for programs on the command
line within a Debian based Linux distro:

```bash
apt-cache search (pattern or name of program you're interested in): This allows you to search for programs on the command line to install.
```

Here's an example of how to apply this idea in action. In this example, let's search
for some terminal emulator programs on Debian's apt package manager by simply providing
"terminal emulator" as the pattern:

```bash
apt-cache search terminal emulator
```

Here's a screenshot of Sakura terminal with tmux running that command:

As you can see, this is pretty powerful, especially if you know a few things about pattern matching
with grep commands. Try using this idea to try some new programs out!
