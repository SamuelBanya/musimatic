I did more thinking about what to deploy on this site.

So far I'm thinking of deploying:

-   An RSS Feed Agregator
-   Stock Ticker
-   Email Server
-   Voip Telephone In Browser
-   BBS
-   Gateway For Echolink, DMR, and Fusion Radio Nodes
-   Webpage For Old-School Computer Emulators
-   OpenStreetMap Page
-   Web fonts repository to store nice fonts (<https://github.com/Finesse/web-fonts-repository>)
-   ytdl-webserver to pre-download YouTube videos
-   Office suite software on a webpage to avoid using "Office-365" or "Google" based software
-   Pastebin without syntax highlighting
-   VPN service
-   Search engine (Searx, etc)
-   URL shortener client
-   Image gallery for my artwork
-   tube, a YouTube-like alternative (<https://prologic.github.io/tube/>)
-   homer, a server app front end page (<https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer>)
-   Apache Guacamole to host VNC's to allow people to access virtual machines online (<http://guacamole.apache.org/>)
-   "Minetest" server (<https://content.minetest.net/packages/?type=game>)
-   Net64 server for multiplayer N64 games (<https://net64-mod.github.io/>)
-   Webpage based IRC client like Kiwi IRC (<https://kiwiirc.com/>)
-   Hawkpost to share encrypted files (<https://hawkpost.co/>)
-   Archivebox to backup bookmarks and other sites (<https://archivebox.io/>)
-   QuakeJS server
-   GNU FM instance (<https://gnu.io/fm/>)

Cool links for other data projects:

Here is a list of some SysAdmin based apps to deploy as well:

Here is a link to some privacy respecting Linux software:

-   <https://prism-break.org/en/categories/gnu-linux/>

Here is a page full of alternative internet and privacy respecting software:

-   <https://redecentralize.github.io/alternative-internet/>

Here are libre software projects (free as in freedom):

-   <https://libreprojects.net/#favs=wikipedia,joindiaspora-com,nextcloud,openstreetmap,jamendo,plos>

Here is an Internet alternative I found called "Freenet":

-   <https://freenetproject.org/index.html>

Clearly... there are several options :)

And a lot of choices to be made ^_^

I'll keep an "Apps" page to host all these ideas pumped up by JS.

Otherwise, my main page will become a Geocities type hub spot sort of page.

Keep having fun,
