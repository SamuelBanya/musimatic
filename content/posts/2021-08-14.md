Hard work pays off.

Though the CSS styling for this page is far from complete and needs a lot of work, the idea is fulfilled:

-   <https://www.musimatic.xyz/pythonprojectwebsites/ArtGallery/artgallery.html>

Basically, I created an entire art gallery page that creates itself.

How it works:

-   A Python 3 script creates the page by iterating through the related image directory on the site, and creates an HTML page.

If you like Python 3, and source code, well, this is for you, since this is how I did it so you can do it on your site
as well:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
import pprint
import itertools

def main():
    with open('/var/www/musimatic/pythonprojectwebsites/ArtGallery/artgallery.html', 'w') as f:
        f.write('<html>')
        f.write('<head>')
        f.write('<title>Art Gallery</title>')
        f.write('<meta charset="utf-8"/>')
        f.write('<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/artgallery.css" type="text/css"/>')
        f.write('</head>')
        f.write('<body>')
        art_gallery_path = '/var/www/musimatic/images/ArtGallery'
        os.chdir(art_gallery_path)
        picture_directories = list(filter(os.path.isdir, os.listdir(art_gallery_path)))
        for directory in picture_directories:
            picture_directory_anchor = str('<a href="#' + str(directory) + '">' + str(directory) + '</a>')
            f.write(picture_directory_anchor)
            f.write('<br />')
        for directory in picture_directories:
            picture_directory_header = str('<h1 id="' + str(directory) + '">' + str(directory) + '</h1>')
            f.write(picture_directory_header)
            f.write('<br />')

            # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4568580/python-glob-multiple-filetypes
            picture_paths_jpg = (x.resolve() for x in Path(directory).glob("*.jpg"))
            picture_paths_png = (x.resolve() for x in Path(directory).glob("*.png"))
            picture_paths_gif = (x.resolve() for x in Path(directory).glob("*.gif"))
            picture_paths = itertools.chain(picture_paths_jpg, picture_paths_png, picture_paths_gif)
            # SO Post on string replacement:
            # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9452108/how-to-use-string-replace-in-python-3-x
            picture_paths_strings = [str(p).replace('/var/www/musimatic/', 'https://musimatic.xyz/') for p in picture_paths]
            pprint.pprint(picture_paths_strings)
            for picture_path in picture_paths_strings:
                picture_img_tag = str('<a target="_blank" href="' + str(picture_path) + '"><img src="' + str(picture_path) + '"/></a>')
                f.write(picture_img_tag)
        f.write('</body>')
        f.write('</html>')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
