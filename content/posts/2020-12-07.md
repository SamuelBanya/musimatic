I tried using my work Windoze laptop to install the PS3 firmware hack, but realized that the dumb laptop doesn't allow flash drives to be used while booted into
Windoze --&gt; Into The Trash (Just kidding... but I wish I could just use Linux all day, one can dream).

I instead utilized the 'md5sum' Linux terminal utility that's built in to verify the 'md5sum' hash of the download, and just utilized pcmanfm-qt to mount the drive.

I then used the following command to format the disk into "FAT32" (or 'vfat' on Linux):

```bash
sudo mkfs -t vfat /dev/sdb1
```

I then listed all of the drives, including the USB flash drive, and verified that the command was successful:

```bash
lsblk -f
```

For reference purposes, I took the idea from this blog post, as I needed to figure this out quickly (because of limited patience, and since I just wanted a hacked
PS3 ASAP), so I must give credit where credit is due, as its a pretty good post:

After much attempts, I was able to get PS3 backup games running just fine with the "Multi-Man" utility, so it's been pretty awesome on that respect.

I plan on also hacking the 3DS later this week with this guide and a new SDXC card:

Speaking of emulation, this page itself goes over what "No-Intro" rom sets were all about, and is worth a read as I'm aware of early ROM dumps of games that had
title screens (annoyingly) but its funny how the same project that aims to remove them included the very same people that put them into ROMs in the first place:

I am also debating the following home based VoIP phone services:
