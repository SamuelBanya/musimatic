I did some slight work on that "Space Weather" app.

I was able to index into the related JSON data from the NOAA Apache Web Server
in the JS console, as its just a JSON object with specific key values.

I'm still debating on how I want it to look though, so I'm torn between the
JQuery UI's "Tabs" vs "Accordian" look.

I found this cool site that gives homage to old Geocities cities, and is worth
looking at, as the guy took assets from older Geocities sites:

-   <https://www.cameronsworld.net/>

An even cooler page is the "Oocities.org" website, which basically archived ALL
of the Geocities web pages before it got taken down.

This means that if you somehow remember your Geocities username, you can find
your site still active here:

-   <http://www.oocities.org/>

Here's a very nichey Super Mario themed Geocities site I found as well:

-   <http://oocities.org/itsamemario2000/english.html?202025>

The reason I was looking into old Geocities sites is that I want my next
re-design of this site to be Geocities themed.

Maybe, just maybe I can find my old Geocities page with all the Pokemon sprites
and icons.

That would be the day.

Also, I've been debating if I should move over to a VoIP setup since even though
I prefer the fliphone setup I currently have, even not having text would be ok
with me too.

Also, they're going to slowly get rid of 3G towers, so sadly I probably would
be forced to move over to a 4G phone eventually.

After that, I would DEFINITELY swap to a home phone at that point with an AX-25
enabled ham radio BBS node in the car to match haha.

These VoIP services were hard to find, but here's a list of potential VoIP
services for personal use since a good chunk of them are geared towards business
use, and I think they're assuming every Zoomer would immediately prefer a
cellphone (Side Node: I'm pretty surprised Vonage still exists):
