I've been trying to get the Searx instance running, but it appears that the
"filtron" component is the part that is doing excessive rate-limiting for some
reason.

I'll have to lurk on their IRC channel to maybe get some feedback of what to do.

Speaking of IRC, I found a couple of links that are interesting and useful
as well to find IRC networks OTHER than Freenode:

-   <https://netsplit.de/networks/>
-   <https://netsplit.de/networks/top100.php>

Been also debating the best ham radio setup as well, since I might just get one
of those meme-y type 40 inch antennas for my HT (Baofeng UV-5R) to improve my
signal strength to hit a few more repeaters for like $20.

We'll see.

Keep having a good time :)
