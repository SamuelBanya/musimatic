I was able to figure out with the help of IRC how to actually git clone my repos as the 'git' user:

For example, if I had SSH access to my VPS on another machine, then I could do:

```bash
git clone -v git@www.musimatic.net:/var/www/git/dotfiles.git
```

Also, I learned how to configure Virtualbox on a Windows 10 'host' to run Devuan inside of it as the 'guest' with the help of this guide:

-   <https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-virtualbox-guest-additions-on-debian-10/>

The only other tweak I had to do was make sure that in Virtualbox, I had went into Settings (Gear Icon) &gt; Display &gt; Graphics Controller: VMSVGA

Pretty stoked because I decked out the Devuan based virtual machine on my Windows 10 work computer with my dotfiles config, which means
I can potentially work primarily in a Linux environment in the near future and never have to touch Windoze for work ever again unless in a VM or
something locally on that machine.
