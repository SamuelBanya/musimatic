I have tweaked the designs of both sites a bit further, and clearly modeled the CSS styling of the buttons from a few examples I found online:

-   <https://musimatic.xyz/>
-   <https://sambanya.com/>

The first one is definitely looking up-to-par, and has vastly improved.

Obviously, I need to create more actual projects, but that comes with time.

Of course, that will only increase once I finish a related Typescript and Postman course, and begin figuring out how to really get more Full Stack experience to create more web apps.

I do have a few goals for the 'sambanya.com' page:

-   Make the portfolio landing page standout with a few nice art examples with a 'Flexbox' gallery:
-   <https://fancyapps.com/playground/17g>
-   Rip the DOS style buttons from this website:
-   <https://www.mistys-internet.website/>

The only thing I'm debating is the actual workflow of obtaining the images themselves again.

I'm tempted to make an 'ArtGalleryCreator3' where it would basically rip the images and create an associated thumbnails folder to then be used to display in a grid at the bottom of the page.

However, I think the end results so far are looking good so far.
