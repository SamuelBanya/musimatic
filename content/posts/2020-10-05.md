I've been debating what I want to do in terms of a JQuery UI style App.

I'm leaning towards using the JQuery UI "Accordian" widget to make some kind
of expandable web app.

I found two cool NOAA based directories to either obtain JSON and image data from:

-   <https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/json/>
-   <https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/images/>

Here's the overarching site if you're interested in other forms of data from
the NOAA server, which is neat since you don't have to apply for an API
key in order to utilize their data:

-   <https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/content/data-access>

Related progress on the "Space Weather" web app can be found here:

Also, a LOT of ideas can be gleaned in terms of space based weather for use
in Ham Radio on this site I found from QRZ, which is CONSTANTLY being linked
on personal ham radio enthusiast pages:

I've also been playing around with some ROM hacking via some related utilities
from this site:

-   <http://www.romhacking.net/>

One ROM hacking utility that worked right from the get-go using WINE in Linux was
"YY-CHR" which allows you to open up a related ROM file, and just edit sprites
right away, which was super cool:

-   <https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/119/>

Now what kind of ROM hack I would make... that I'm not sure. But I'll admit, it
is super cool how easy it is to just open up a game's sprites and just have at it
so I'll come up with something cool I guess.

Way easier than attempting to make a game in some constantly shilled engine
like Unity or something.

Probably will make a ROM hack for Gameboy Color ;)

I've been debating what separate piano songs to learn, so I've taken a look
at some video game based sheet music:

Also, I got Qemu to load up on the Linux Desktop, so I'm planning on installing
Gentoo in a VM this weekend when I get a chance.

Looking forward to learning some more hands-on Linux skills, and finally taking
the Gentoo challenge.

Keep having fun :)
