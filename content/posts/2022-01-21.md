Found a couple of cool illustrators via this YouTube playlist named 'illustratori', which I'm assuming is Italian for 'illustrators':

-   <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYoJN0iAttfVjzGFpvMFkAXdbDYYsOdS>-

Here are the highlights of what I found

-   Mirko Hanak: Cool illustrator that emphasizes the watercolor WITHOUT an outline, very cool and unique:

-   Syd Mead: Cool sci-fi illustrator into retro futurism kind of art:

-   Chesley Bonestell: Cool sci-fi illustrator into sci-fi type backgrounds:

-   Zdzislaw Beksinski (I like the color usage, but dang is this guy's work dreary and death based)

Inspiring stuff for the most part.

In terms of Linux stuff, I tried installing Emacs on ScPup64 aka a derivative of Slacko Puppy Linux this week, and its been a mess trying to find the different dependencies present even with help on their forums.

Going to just stick with Manjaro for the time being until I can MAYBE find a Puppy or Dog Linux derivative that has Emacs 27+ by default.
