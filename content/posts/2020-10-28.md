I am looking into how to deploy "cgit" instead of my current GitWeb instance,
as I never seem to use it anyway, and kind of think it sucks.

There's something a bit uninviting for it, especially if you just have it present
to show dotfiles or something else in a public repo.

Here's the site for 'cgit':

-   <https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about/>

I did find a blog post on the same topic that I might rip from if I can't figure
out to get it working on 'nginx' myself though. I do still plan on building it
from source as I don't see a Debian based port unfortunately:

-   <https://eliteinformatiker.de/2020/02/16/installing-cgit-nginx-on-debian>

Here's a related example article from 'nginx' on deploying a FastCGI to host
something like 'cgit':

-   <https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/fastcgiexample/>

An even neater thing to note is the 'cgit' creator's own website:

-   <https://www.zx2c4.com/>

I absolutely love how he just displays his projects in a never ending page,
that basically links to just cgit repos for each project. That is PERFECT.
I plan on trying to do the same thing once I get my 'cgit' instance working.

His own 'cgit' instance is awesome too, and I love the idea of mirrors at the
bottom as well:

One minor 'wget' command I learned today to archive entire sites is the following
command:

```bash
wget -r -np -nH -R index.html
```

The parameters that it uses include (from the 'wget' man page):

-   -r: recursive: Retrieve recursively
-   -np: no parent: Do not ever ascend to the parent directory when retrieving recursively
-   -nH: no host directories: disable generation of host-prefixed directories
-   -R: reject list: Specify comma-separated lists of file name suffixes or patterns to accept or reject

You can use this to archive your own site from a Linux bash terminal.

I've been debating what mail program to deploy for my own email next year, as I want to move away
from the paid service I've been using. It's okay, but I want the challenge of doing it myself.

Since I already pay for a separate VPS for this site, and paid for a year of service for the other
paid email provider, I think it makes more sense to just then beef up this VPS instead.

On that note, I might even jump to a different VPS provider like Vultur or something.

These are the email clients I've been debating to deploy:

-   <https://mailcow.email/>
-   <https://www.dovecot.org/>
-   <http://www.postfix.org/>
-   <https://www.opensmtpd.org/>

The only downside to hosting your own email is that you have to nuke spam emails from orbit with
the right tools.

Some of the best tools I've seen include the following:

-   <https://www.rspamd.com/>
-   <https://spamassassin.apache.org/>

Have fun archiving sites, and deploying your own email.
