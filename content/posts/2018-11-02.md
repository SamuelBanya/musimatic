I updated the "Visit Monaco" website with more object orientated specific methods and properties (String
and Number Objects in particular). I also have been working on fixing the time module issue for the MTA
Express or Local App. I also have begun learning C# 7.0 within the last two weeks, and posted my latest
progress work, as well as a Bloomberg related C# 7.0 webscraper project.
