Still working on the "Space Weather" JQuery UI app.

I got the actual K-Index and Sunspot data to display on the page itself, so that's
pretty cool. I also got the "K Index" graph to also display by using appropriate
"src" attribute for the related img tag. Only thing I have to modify is to
include a setTimeout() statement to have it continously looping. Otherwise, its
pretty much done:

Now to think of what to do for a simple Angular JS app next :)

Maybe something with open data feeds, not sure.

Was gonna mess around with the solderless breadboard setup I have to learn a
bit of electronics, but I was a bit dumb and forgot to buy a multimeter, as
well as a few ranges of resistors as I assumed the starter kit I got came with
everything.

Boy, was I wrong.

More so, I'm debating getting a Ardunino Uno copy from Amazon as well since
its purpose is primarily for entry level electronics as well, and they're
super cheap and run on USB powerbanks, so there's no risk of getting shocked
or anything while learning basic circuits.

I'd like to build up basic circuits, and maybe make a few small synths eventually.

Here's to learning,
