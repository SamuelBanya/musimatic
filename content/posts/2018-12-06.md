I made small progress this week towards Python and C#, since I've had to deal with web hosting
issues this week. I am currently in the process of making a Garfield themed fan website to showcase
the skills I have gained from Chapter 4 from the HTML+CSS and JS books. I have also begun learning
Ruby on the weekend as well, and updated my GitHub repo with all my progress as of late, but will
rehost on Repl.it when I get the chance so that beginners can try out my code on their own as well.
