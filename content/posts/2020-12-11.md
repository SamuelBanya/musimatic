I haven't felt well at all stomach-wise for the last few days, but today, I worked through it to get back into a routine.

I did a lot of self-reflection today, and realized that all the goals I set aside for work-related things really actually came to fruition this year.

I still haven't decked out my Emacs work configuration as far as it can just yet, and even then, that's probably maybe even 15% of the potential I could probably
experience with a finely tweaked Emacs setup. Even so, I was advised many times on IRC to really really really actually utilize Emacs Window Manager, so I might take
the dive. However, despite all of this, I am pretty proud what I know now compared to what I knew two years ago. It's mindblowing looking back, and really positive as
well as humbling at the same time.

I re-organized all of the Org docs on my Devuan machine, and the result looks great. Even the ~/hub directory looks awesome too. I have been debating how to really
handle how to handle backups though for all of my stuff. Most likely I am going to utilize the Raspberry Pi 3 along with a 2 TB drive to jerryrig a poorman's LAN based
NAS.

I got an SDXC card, and am also pretty excited to hack my old Nintendo 3DS soon too for homebrew and backups.

Might look into installing FreeBSD in a VM as I would like all my "Just Works" machines to be based in that. If its a Desktop machine, then I'll use Openbox as the window
manager. If its a laptop, then its using AwesomeWM...

OR, I might look into seeing if there's a better lightweight alternative to AwesomeWM with an easier config file, as I DESPISE how it depends upon Lua script to configure
it. The syntax sucks. I would rather learn more ELisp to tweak Emacs than to try to figure out how Lua script works.

Even more so, I am at the point where I am debating removing the top widget altogether, and just displaying the current numbered "Desktop" within Tmux and do full screen
for each Desktop window.

I basically want the most minimal X-Org server based window manager that would just boot into X. Ideally so I can just focus on terminal apps, with maybe a GUI browser
for stuff like banking websites and the like that depend upon sneaky JS scripts.

Some lightweight window managers I'm considering include:

-   i3: <https://i3wm.org/>
-   bspwm: <https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm>
-   herbstluftwm: <https://www.herbstluftwm.org/>
-   xmonad: <https://xmonad.org/>
-   spectrwm: <https://github.com/conformal/spectrwm>
-   jwm (Joe's Window Manager): <http://joewing.net/projects/jwm/>
-   qtile: <http://www.qtile.org/>
-   ratpoison: <https://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/>
-   dwm: <https://dwm.suckless.org/>

All I know is that one day, I hope to rival K. Mandela's site (<https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/>) in either content or accessibility and ideas to really push
terminal apps, Emacs, Vim, and Linux / FreeBSD forward!

Hoping I feel better soon though, but happy to keep my mind occupied!
