Found five pretty sick Dungeon Synth albums today:

-   <https://protodome.bandcamp.com/album/4000ad>
-   <https://zweihander.bandcamp.com/album/primeval>
-   <https://darkagelegendry.bandcamp.com/album/barbarian-master-2>
-   <https://bookofskelos.bandcamp.com/album/cryptic-conjurations>
-   <https://mystictowers.bandcamp.com/album/caverns-of-crystal>

Makes me want to complete the one synth album I've been working on for a bit, and really learn the Ardour DAW a bit better to use similar synth VST's.

What's nuts about that first 'Protodome' album above is that the guy made it with 'Î¼MML' or 'Micro Music Macro Language', from his own personal GitHub project:

Found an additional cool OST album as well for a game that was apparently made in a week as well, neat:

-   <https://zan-zan-zawa-veia.bandcamp.com/album/diggin-it-ost>

Also found a crazy Impulse Tracker based album too:

-   <https://daas.bandcamp.com/album/selected-early-dos>

Found another computer music based album too, alot of neat DOS and Windows 95 type sounds:

-   <https://tecknic.bandcamp.com/album/computer-music?from=hp>

Found a cool ambient tape album as well:

-   <https://lostarmor.bandcamp.com/album/split-2>

Found a cool Japanese artist who makes random MIDI songs:

-   <https://tozo.bandcamp.com/album/sushi-stream>

Found a cool synth album in which there are brief songs, purely made from synth samples and messing around with analog equipment:

-   <https://analogsamples.bandcamp.com/album/spectral-oddities>

Found a cool album that just features random DOS music:

-   <https://tozo.bandcamp.com/album/sukombu>
