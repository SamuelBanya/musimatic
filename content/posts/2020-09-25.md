I found out about "SDR", which is Software Defined Radio through someone who
talked about this on IRC.

This is better explained on the SDR website found here:

-   <http://www.websdr.org/>

Also, there are other ways to listen to Ham Radio online, so check out this link:

Just give the SDR's below a shot by loading one of the links below in a modern
GUI based web browser, and play around with the tuner (yellow icon) to change
the frequency. You can also change the "band" to change the different wavelength
bands as well. Also, you can listen to basic FM/AM radio too if you're into that
sort of thing.

Here's the list of web-based SDR's I found:

Washington DC Area Based Web SDR:

Northern Utah Area Based Web SDR:

-   <http://www.sdrutah.org/>

Milford, PA Based Web SDR:

-   <http://k3fef.com:8901/>

Currently debating between two separate radios, both of which can be programmed
easily via CHIRP:

-   Anytone AT-778
-   Anytone 5888

I've also been looking into how to properly connect to BBS's via this link:

Keep having fun :)
