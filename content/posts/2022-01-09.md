I have been trying to figure out how to contribute to Emacs Org Mode and Puppy Linux.

In terms of my web development projects, I can't seem to get my ElectronJS project to actually produce sound on Linux, but modeling it after a similar example from GitHub, I was able to get it to work on the workbased Macbook:

-   <https://github.com/SamuelBanya/SimpleSynth>

This is the project that I heavily modeled after since the docs on ElectronJS on how to actually incorporate other libraries like sound libraries (ex: synths, etc) are very limited, and there are barely any actual working examples that do this on the ElectronJS docs page:

-   <https://github.com/starakaj/tone-electron>

I think what I've realized is that some advice from a developer at a couple jobs ago was absolutely right:

-   Just stick with web apps in an actual browser

This is to avoid having to support desktop apps that vary so widely on different architectures on different machines.

It's better to just have it work in a modern browser so that I can at least present the work.

Hoping to at least get it working in the next week or so, but if it doesn't, I might just host it on an actual page and move on. I don't want to spend too much time on a simple music application that doesn't work, and would rather it would 'just work'.
