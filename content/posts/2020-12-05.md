Enjoying surfing the net this fine Saturday morning, and I came across a few cool things in terms of old-school Geocities-esque pages.

This is a cool designed "Neocities" site that I absolutely adore the color and design of, never thought to put the navigation pane on the far right:

-   <https://jackomix.neocities.org/collection/>

This is a search engine you can use to find older pages:

-   <https://wiby.me/>

Found a page that imparts the old-school tropes of all those 90's pages too. I forgot about the visitor counter, and background MIDI music, good idea ;)

-   <https://www.business2community.com/social-buzz/make-fly-90s-website-geocities-tribute-01531323>

Found a cool tech reference page as well:

-   <http://web.archive.org/web/20080730090550/http://oldfiles.org.uk/lightspeed/main.html>

That reminds me... I should probably start working on the site re-design to de-clutter this site again for the next re-design. Looking forward to it!

For the website re-design, I do plan on including a "Recipes" section in which I literally have a .org files for any of the food recipes I often refer to
(which contain links to the actual people who made them for author credit purposes). Since .org files are pretty readable on its own, I don't think I'll need
to convert to .pdfs either, since that would take a lot of space. However, it would convince a lot of people interested in learning how to cook Hungarian food
to also utilize Emacs Org Mode, so its a Win-Win :)

Other than that, I was debating if I should hack the PS3 first, or figure out how to run Wii, Gamecube, and Wii-U backups on the hacked Wii-U I have.

Since I've been taking a mind vacation from doing anything major in terms of pet projects, I got a lot of great ideas for the "Sieges" side band, and plan
on really exploring the potential of the Dungeon-Synth genre. There's probably going to be a lot of spoken word tropes with heavy reverb, and continuous motifs
to match.

Really looking forward to getting my work-based Emacs config to get email working as that will help my daily workflow so much.

Keep Having Fun!
