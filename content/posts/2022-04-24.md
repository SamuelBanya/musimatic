'ArtPortfolioCreator' is now complete:

-   <https://github.com/SamuelBanya/ArtPortfolioCreator>

Adjusted the stylesheets of both of the following pages to match:

-   <https://sambanya.com/>
-   <https://www.sambanya.com/music.html>

End result:

-   An art portfolio page that finally just works as intended by simply dumping all portfolio images into a single directory, and letting the page create itself via an hourly crontab job.
