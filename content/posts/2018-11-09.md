I updated the "Visit Monaco" website to include Math and Number JavaScript object specific methods. I also
fixed the time module specific issue for the Express or Local MTA Python app, but need to fix the looping
issue for each of the stats. I also will follow a YouTube tutorial for the C# based Bloomberg webscraper,
since the Iron Webscraper module isn't able to be imported with Repl.it.
