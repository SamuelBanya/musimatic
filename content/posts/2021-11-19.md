I added some older projects to the 'git.musimatic.xyz' site, specifically under an 'Archive' repo:

-   <https://git.musimatic.xyz/Archive/tree/>

I also open sourced my projects running on crontab jobs on this site as well:

-   <https://git.musimatic.xyz/ArtGalleryCreator/tree/>
-   <https://git.musimatic.xyz/Bandcamper/tree/>
-   <https://git.musimatic.xyz/ScriptureOfTheDay/tree/>
-   <https://git.musimatic.xyz/RandomCSSColorGenerator/tree/>

For my new job, I've been working on making 'hello world' typo repos as well as some basic GUI type program examples for the team
to learn from. Reason being is that I have to deal with a variety of programming languages to assist Dev's on a daily basis, so
I wanted to know how the very basics of the following languages at the bare minimum:

-   Python
-   Java (Maven, Gradle)
-   Ruby
-   DotNet (C#)
-   JS (NodeJS)
-   Elixir

I've shifted to primarily doing some skill-building work-based tasks in the beginning half of a given week (Mon to Wed) and then
just doing my own thing towards the end of a given week Thursday onward. It has done wonders for my mental health, and would
recommend anyone else to do the same if possible if they're trying to move their careers forward, but somehow balance it all.
Life is kind of insane these days, so its good to keep it in check if you can, God willing.

Other than that, I hacked a PS4 the other week, and the older Nintendo Switch I had laying around. However, more so, I got an
RCM Loader device which allows me to apply CFW (Custom Firmware) without needing to plug the Switch into a computer, which is
really nice and convenient since it's kind of a pain to load any form of 'Tegra' using Linux. Now if only I could get
'Gold Leaf' to work properly (probably through related but obscure GitHub patches), that would be cool too.

Been primarily working on ink drawing when I can though. Might contribute to Emacs Org Mode though one of these days, as
I'm looking for the PR commit experience :)

Planning on getting an Odroid soon to get a good SAMBA share drive going so I can easily access the ton of art resources I have
on a 4TB drive laying around:

Related YouTube video which showcases it, and got me interested, as I was kind of getting sick of my Dell Optiplex file server
setup I currently have since its a bit bulky. It even supports "Wake On LAN" with magic packets which is sick:
