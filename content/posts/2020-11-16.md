I finished the 'w3mBookmarkSorter' project. Its beautiful, and works just as intended.

I am debating to mail this to the 'w3m' team as a patch plugin for 'w3m' via email as I think anyone who uses 'w3m' would absolutely LOVE this functionality,
as w3m doesn't sort bookmarks at all by default.

Emacs Conference 2020 is coming up next weekend (Thanksgiving weekend) and I'm looking forward to some of the talks, especially the talks with
Rainer KÃ¶nig, who has some amazing Org-Mode tutorials on YouTube, and RMS (Richard Stallman).

Here's Emacs Conference 2020 for anyone interested, as its virtual this year:
