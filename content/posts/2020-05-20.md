I learned a lot with w3m in the past few days but more so today,
since I've been able to utilize a few macros from the YouTuber,
gotbletu's videos on the topic.

Here's gotbletu's related video on the topic of advanced macros in
w3m browser:

Here are some example commands that I added to my 'keymap' file
in my ~/.w3m/ directory so that I can easily do some w3m commands
with ease, the last of which I came up on my own to toggle the
'color' command in w3m to allow for color to be displayed on a
page:

keymap  \\\\\t    COMMAND       "SET_OPTION display_borders=toggle ; RESHAPE"
keymap  \\\\\i    COMMAND       "SET_OPTION display_image=toggle ; RELOAD"
keymap  \\\\\e    COMMAND       "SET_OPTION user_agent='' ; RELOAD"
keymap  \\\\\a    COMMAND       "SET_OPTION user_agent='Opera/9.80 (S60; SymbOS; Opera Mobi/SYB-1107071606; U; en) Presto/2.8.149 Version/11.10' ; RELOAD"
keymap	\\\\\c COMMAND	      "SET_OPTION color=toggle ; RELOAD"
