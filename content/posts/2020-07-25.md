I am happy to note that my git repos are live at the following site:
<https://git.musimatic.net/>

What does this mean?

You can see the progress of any of my own public repos that I contribute to, so that you can steal my 'dotfiles' configurations for your own use
to tweak for example.

For example, I will literally be able to go to another machine, pull down related configurations, and it would look exactly like my current
machine without any problems.

I've been at this for a dang week, and I'm happy to note that its all because I had to be inclusive of ports INCLUDING port 80, which is the specific
port that helps handle HTTP requests on the web.

Because the lack of Nginx docs or guides on how to specifically configure "GitWeb" to work, I'm literally going to copy and paste my working config
so that anyone using 'nginx' can benefit from it as I had to use over 5 different separate guides to even attempt to figure it out:

NOTE: You'll have to place this in your '/etc/nginx/sites-available' directory on your website's VPS as a file name of your choose, for ex:
you can save it as 'git':

```python3
server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        server_name git.musimatic.net www.git.musimatic.net;

        location / {
                root /usr/share/gitweb;
                index index.cgi;
        }

        location /index.cgi {
                root /usr/share/gitweb/;
                include fastcgi_params;
                gzip off;
                fastcgi_param SCRIPT_NAME $uri;
                fastcgi_param GITWEB_CONFIG /etc/gitweb.conf;
                fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/fcgiwrap.socket;
        }
}
```

Here are the specific links I found to be IMMENSELY useful in this process of using 'nginx' with Debian 10 and GitWeb:
