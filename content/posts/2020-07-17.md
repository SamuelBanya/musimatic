I am in the process of trying to figure out how to get the Git bare repos online as public repos on this site.

Unfortunately, the Git book is mostly 'Apache2' based, which doesn't help because this site is now running using 'nginx'.

However I did find a couple links that I have to go through to make some decisions on how to properly configure and serve the following directory:
git.musimatic.net

I'm also debating whether or not I should even serve the Git repos in
the _var/www_ directory on this site as well or keep to using the
/srv/git repo as mentioned in the Git book.

Helpful reference links on how to possibly do this include:

-   <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Smart-HTTP>
-   <https://serverfault.com/questions/483726/how-to-make-git-smart-http-transport-work-on-nginx>
-   <https://www.toofishes.net/blog/git-smart-http-transport-nginx/>
-   <https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/ubuntu-git-server-installation/>

Ideally, my Git repos would look like the one from 'Suckless.org', which looks awesome,
minimum, and just perfect:

Things To To Do This Weekend:

1.  Work on my C based ncurses project as well.
2.  Learn more JS for work and keep utilizing this practice site as a means to apply the techniques from the related chapter: <https://musimatic.net/FakeWebsites/PageCeption/index.html>
3.  Work on my "ArmoryApp" NodeJS / Electron based app for work as well. It's coming along pretty nicely as I'm able to automatically pull logs for the one app I help do tech support for, which is pretty cool.
4.  Configure the Devuan work based VM so I can move all my work inside of it.
5.  Keep researching how to install Gentoo and configure the related installation guide.
6.  Deploy 'Searx' public instance on this site now that I have the desired 'nginx' + 'Debian' combo that's preferred
7.  Make Awk script to sort ~/.w3m/bookmark.html based on &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; tags present
8.  Make LinkedIn Job Scraper based on their API so I don't have to use LinkedIn anymore +10k points for making an NCURSES interface to read results afterwards
9.  Learn more from gotbletu videos
10. Work on weather based webscraper based on attr.in, and the National Weather Service Apache server to display the contents on a webpage
11. Turn Emacs into a C based IDE with this guide: <https://martinsosic.com/development/emacs/2017/12/09/emacs-cpp-ide.html>
