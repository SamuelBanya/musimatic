I've made better progress with adding more Chapter 3 ideas for the Visit Monaco website by including Browser
Object Model, and Document Object Model ideas, as well as solidifying object orientated scripts in the stats
section. The MTA Express or Local app is taking longer than expected since I can't figure out how to interpret
stop_id and train id values to make it feasible yet. I found two related projects, and messaged these devs
for advice, and posted on the MTA Google + group. My Lubuntu D23 patch was finally committed by Wxl earlier
this week, making my first contribution official. I also updated the programming projects section with more
"Automate The Boring Stuff with Python" related chapter examples.
