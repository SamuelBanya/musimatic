With the help from some programmers on the #Python IRC channel, I have been able to run the Hockey Webscraper
successfully. The only thing remaining for this project is to add team logos as another dictionary of .jpeg
pictures within the same directory. I have also continued to make progress in "Automate the Boring Stuff
with Python", and also have updated the "Visit Monaco" webpage with a few more scripts in the Stats webpage.

I have also been going back and forth on Beeware's Gitter page to get more help running the tests necessary
for their open source project. I'm aiming to probably start learning GIT as well to help with this website.
