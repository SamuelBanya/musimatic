I found a few art gallery pages worth stealing design ideas from, which include William L. Eaken's illustration page:

-   <http://eaken.net/illustration_index.html>

Love the layout, how each thumbnail reveals a corresponding page. I could probably accomplish this but would have to create automatically
generated pages for each and every artwork I have. No way would I do this by hand, but its definitely possible with a CronTab job Python 3 script though.

Just thinking of some good layouts to replace the art gallery page with, aka here's my current work in progress using the "CSS Grid Layout", though
I would much rather a left sidebar. Will have to rework it a bit, and also make it just somehow have two columns, one for the menu, the second column
for the rest of the content, aka time to revisit CSS styling ideas I barely remember, fun times:

Might steal the entire design of this site as well, we'll see:
