I released the second JeeveSobs album called "Breakpoints":

-   <https://jeevesobs.bandcamp.com/album/breakpoints>

Planning to do a synth based third album later on. Probably will involve using 'JACK' via 'qjackctl' with multiple input
configurations between synths, drum machines, and lots of samples with loops. Should be a lot of fun.
