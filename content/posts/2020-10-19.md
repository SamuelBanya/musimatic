I re-organized the site a bit more, and got rid of the "Radio" section as I
really only had web apps on that page anyway.

Though I think Ham Radio is pretty cool, I'm still not that versed or well
into the hobby yet to show off any cool projects, so I think its a bit of a waste
to have a section on that topic anyway.

With that in mind, I re-organized all those web apps I've made just on the
"Programming" site itself:

I'm checking out how to make a literal Emacs config from an Org Mode document
to help simplify things a bit, should be fun!
