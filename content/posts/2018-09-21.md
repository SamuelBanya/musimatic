I have been making more progress on the Express or Local Python app with the help of IRC members from the
\#Python channel. I'm getting closer to being able to parse through the unbuffered .proto protocol data
stream from MTA, and will work with it to make it useable. I've been also implementing more object orientated
scripts for the "Visit Monaco" website as well.
