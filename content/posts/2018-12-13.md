I again made little progress to my projects this week due to personal things.
I am in the process of making a Garfield themed fake website, and have been actively trying
to redo the Python based Express or Local project using an example project I found. I also am
learning Ruby on the weekends, and am planning to do a Yelp related project based on restaurants
in Sunnyside, Queens.
