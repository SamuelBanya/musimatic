I tried to install Jitsi Meet but failed because of these two dumb
issues that still haven't been resolved by the Jitsi team:

Related GitHub issue on the same topic:
<https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/6371>

Duplicate issue where they're still working on this issue:
<https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/pull/6627>

Basically, in a nutshell, they're using "Certbot-Auto", which has
been deprecated for releases like Ubuntu 20.04.

This means that unless they patch this into the installation shell
scripts, I would manually have to apply a workaround using 'certbot' to
install the appropriate certificate, and manually configure a lot of the
files present to get it to run. I don't feel comfortable doing that so,
I just nuked the Jitsi Meet private instance I created.

On the flip side, I plan on deploying a private Searx instance, so that
I never have to use Google or DuckDuckGo again myself, so that'll be fun.

This time though, I'll read through the whole documentation to make sure
that Searx is cool with Ubuntu 20.04.

'searx' can be found here, and you can actively use some public instances of it,
though its more recommended to host your own instance to make sure its as secure
as possible since YOU control it in that case:

On a good note, I was able to install Doom Emacs just fine, and I have gotta say,
it looks, feels, and just responds amazingly. I know other Emacs enthusiasts would
just say "its someone else's config" but I've been using Vanilla Emacs for quite
a bit, and there's just so much that should have been added right out of the box
as a default like this.

So it goes without saying, I'm back to using Vim style bindings, and I'm pretty
happy about it. I still know Emacs style bindings for other shell programs wherever
needed, but let's all agree Vim bindings are 100x better and more intuitive.
Those who think they've memorized every C-c or C-o style binding in Emacs is
insane, or is straight up lying. Some are intuitive for starters but when you
delve into Org-mode with vanilla Emacs bindings, then you realize its almost impossible
for a normal person to remember half of the bindings anyway.

Otherwise, I have the week off, and am doing the following checklist of things to do
to keep myself occupied, and have been pretty happy about the progress so far:
