Found this artist aka 'Flooko' who does some cool sci-fi type paintings.

He does a ton of timelapse videos on YouTube which showcases his technique to make acrylic paintings, cool stuff:

Found another artist that does Elder Scroll paintings as well which is neat, since they do it on small canvas discs:
