I've been in the process of trying to get "BasiliskII" emulator to work, so that I can run some cool
old Mac programs for fun. I was thinking to maybe setup my old Raspberry Pi 3 to boot into BasiliskII
to run MacOS7 or MacOS8 to possibly do some cool audio recording ideas, and play some old games / use
older Mac software.

This link looks promising as a good guide, but we'll see:

For the time being, I've been checking out Internet Archive's collections for fun.
