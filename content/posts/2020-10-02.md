Learned a little more about APIs from the JS book I have.

Debating what kind of web app I should create, either with JQuery UI, or
Angular, just for the experience, and also debating the "why" aspect of it.

Also debating what else to deploy on this site, will most likely be one of
the following ideas:

-   Unreallircd Server
-   Mumble Server
-   Jitsi Instance
-   Searx Instance
-   BBS

I've been playing around with KiwiSDR, which is another "Software Defined Radio"
type website where people basically allow you to play around with their already
configured shortwave radio via a web page.

Here's a few helpful links regarding KiwiSDR:

List of public instances of KiwiSDR:

Map of existing public instances of KiwiSDR:

Signal-to-noise ratio score based site that ranks KiwiSDR instances in terms
of how loud their signal is:

And hey, there are a BUNCH of Hungarian KiwiSDR's present too, here are a few:
