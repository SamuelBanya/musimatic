Fixed script issues on Collar website for Spin To Win webpage, and adjusted styling consistently throughout
the website. It's complete, and I like how it looks with Bootstrap. I tried adding a dropdown menu nav bar
with Bootstrap, but this is not necessarily working out easily. Will try again next week.
