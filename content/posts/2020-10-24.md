I mostly chilled out today and did some art.

Here's a cool link to a site that features color cycling art from Mark Ferrari
that you can experience in your browser. You can change the time of day, and
observe the constant shift of color palettes as a result. Really neat and
inspiring scenes:

Hope everyone is well.
