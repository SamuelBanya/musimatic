A Brief History Of The Emacs Text Editor

Richard Stallman created Emacs in late 1976 after combining the MIT lab 'E' text editor, with
a set of macros to make the text editor easier to use.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

The Basics Of Emacs:
I have begun to learn the text editor, Emacs, with the use of their in-built tutorials.
I have always liked Vim, but would like to learn both in case it become useful later for
a future Dev or Dev Ops role. If there's something I've liked so far is the capability of
using multiple buffers, as well as the idea to use multiple plugins to treat Emacs truly as
an all-in-one OS-like application.

Useful Beginner Emacs Shortcuts:
