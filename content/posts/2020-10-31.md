I deployed my 'cgit' instance here:

-   git.musimatic.net

I basically replaced the existing 'GitWeb' instance with 'cgit', which is really nice. All it needs is
a dark theme, and I think it should be fine.

I tweaked my Emacs config a bit, and its looking pretty good so far. I'm pretty impressed with just the
simply default zoom based Hydra command for example since I really like the idea behind it to just keep
repeating the same macro until another key is pressed.

Helm is pretty cool, but the colors with the somewhat default Emacs theme looks a bit jenky, so I might have
to tweak it a bit. Also the "Ranger" implementation from MELPA kind of sucks, and makes me want to instead
utilize a shell within Emacs for all my 'tmux' based programs to be pretty honest.

I kind of hate 'dired' mode as its not really inviting, intuitive, or helpful in terms of what features it
can provide. I think Ranger is far superior to this, so I think the best thing I could do is to somehow run
'tmux' in a shell and go from there.

I played around with the Geocities re-design of the site, and I'll admit, its pretty fun going back to basics
in terms of CSS styling. Bootstrap, although nice looking for some startup websites, is a bit too much, and
in itself kind of generic if you think about it.

I think my best approach would be to just make the new Geocities site mobile friendly first (or I guess, just
not care about mobile) and then size it up from there.

I tried to install Emacs Window Manager on Gentoo, but didn't realize that my networking device had reverted
from 'eth0' to some randomized interface name, which is a bit annoying. I had to modify the Grub init file to
allow the ethernet cable network adapter to just be named as 'eth0' to resolve the connection issues. With
that in mind, I'll have to try EXWM another day.

I've been debating what IRC server to install. I'll have to probably use 'Unrealirc' for the IRC server itself,
or 'ngIRCd':

-   <https://www.unrealircd.org/>
-   <https://ngircd.barton.de/>

In terms of the front-end IRC webpage, I think I'll probably choose one of the following:

-   <https://convos.chat/>
-   <https://kiwiirc.com/>
-   <https://thelounge.chat/>
-   <https://quassel-irc.org/>
