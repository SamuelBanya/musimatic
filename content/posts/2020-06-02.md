I'll be working on one of these topics tomorrow:

| TODO List Item                                                                                                     | Reason                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Make the images part of this site actually useable                                                              | Because it could look better                           |
| 2. Migrate all my repos off GitHub and onto public ones on this site,  and be done with Microsoft once and for all | Because life could be even that much better            |
| 3. Install Devuan in a virtual machine on my laptop, take notes, and replace all Debian drives with Devuan         | Because 'systemd' is evil                              |
| 4. Debate a few Thinkpads to libreboot (Thinkpad X400s, Thinkpad X200, Thinkpad X220)                              | Because Richard Stallman was right                     |
| 5. Keep researching best ways to make a small homestead                                                            | Because God will provide for my family when its needed |
| 6. Learn some cool Linux based apps to use in both 'x' and in TTY Linux terminals                                  | Because minimalism always is good                      |
| 7. Keep learning C, while looking ahead in the book chapters itself / look into ncurses documentation              | Because C is an awesome programming language           |
| 8. Keep figuring out ways to make my worklife more manageable with Emacs Org Mode                                  | Because its been a huge help in productivity           |
| 9. Keep reading the good word with 'KJV'                                                                           | Because God's Will is the best plan                    |

God Bless.
