I changed the "favicon" for my site to be a cool neat lightning bolt I customized
myself, which you'll see at the top of each tab.

The fact that it had the old stupid "InMotion" favicon bothered the heck out
of me recently, so I decided it was time to get rid of it once and for all.

I originally tried using this site to create the favicon using some example
Pokemon sprites:

-   <https://favicomatic.com/>

However, I realized this site was a little bit easier to use, allowed you to
edit it on the fly, and even allowed you to export it:

-   <https://www.favicon.cc/>

I'm pretty happy with the results, as icon work brings back such good feelings,
and remind me of fun Geocities pages, especially my old one.

Now if I could just find my old email and dig up my Geocities name and find the
associated site, and bring it back to life!

Now THAT would be something!

Keep enjoying life :)
