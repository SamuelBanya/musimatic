I revamped my VPS and Raspberry Pi within the last couple of days.

Also, I added a random crontab job that changes the color scheme of the front page every 5 minutes for fun. The
results are cool, and here to stay. Might even make it more wacky with some interesting background images, who
knows.

I did some deep thinking and yeah, I'm not gonna host any bloated web apps on the site since I really feel like
I just don't want to showcase any more bloat on the web anymore. However, I might make some cool useful
autogenerated pages though, as I have a few more ideas up my sleeve.

Still working on that JeeveSobs album, but mostly just mixing at this point. Debating putting it on cassette tape
for a limited release of like 10 to 20 tapes max. Will need a tape deck from eBay though, but it'll be a cool
thing to learn, and I already have the album design done anyway.

I modded my Nintendo Switch as well, and its pretty neat, though I don't often play games that much anymore.
I've been more focused on just knocking out some life based todo list stuff in terms of goals, and have
felt a lot more well-rounded.

I've been practicing guitar once a day again instead of just the weekends, and honestly, its been a blast.
It's like I never stopped years ago, and I've been just going over what the best teacher (Pebber Brown) has
to offer on his YouTube video playlist, which is here for reference:

I've been itching to make my own guitar from parts, so I might do this with a premade double-cut guitar body
with a pre-made neck, and figure out how to spraypaint it, etc.

I've been slowly becoming more interested in the Amiga itself. In terms of Amiga OS variants, I found quite a
few, which are showcased in the following links:

-   "AROS" which is the "Amiga Replacement OS"
-   <https://aros.sourceforge.io/pictures/screenshots/>
-   "ApolloOS Free 68K OS (AROS based) running on Amiga Vampire 4 Standalone":
-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqv_4IciF2U>
-   Build an Aros based Amiga computer from scrap parts Part 1
-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttylXRD1S1I>
-   Why use Amiga in 2011? (AmigaOS 4, MorphOS, AROS, AmigaOS 3.9)

I've been debating what Linux distro to use instead of Gentoo because I kind of find the whole kernel updating
process a bit annoying. I'm not sure, but something about it doesn't excite me really. I kind of want the OS to
be minimal, dependable, and NOT to be Windoze or Mac. Also, waiting for compilation of packages doesn't really
help either. Might change to Slackware instead, but have been looking for Gentoo derivatives for the time being.

Here's what I found:

-   Gentoo Studio (I really like how so much is included in terms of audio DAW stuff, would totally put this on the Desktop)
-   <https://gentoostudio.org/>
-   CloverOS
-   <https://gitgud.io/cloveros/cloveros#what-is-cloveros>
-   Funtoo
-   <https://www.funtoo.org/Welcome>
-   Redcore Linux (Looks a bit try-hard, or weird, but I like what it aims to do)
-   <https://redcorelinux.org/>
-   Sabayon Linux
-   <https://www.sabayon.org/>

In terms of my desktop computer, I tried adding this cool Macintosh theme to my "Just Werks" Devuan desktop, but the theme just didn't work
right, even with MATE desktop:

At this point, I might just keep using JUST LxQT desktop with Openbox and focus on that since it can do tiling window management if needed.

I've decided on a couple of good email server names, so I might deploy that within the next couple of months since I really would love
to host my own email. I kind of got fed up with proprietary ones like MS Outlook or Yahoo! always complaining when I use the UBlock Origin
extension (<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/>) to block tons of ads. This just makes it all the more
important to just take out those service providers from my workflow since if they're basically selling all my data just for a "free" service,
they're just not worth it.
