<p>
I've been busy with working on some coursework for the past few weeks.
</p>

<p>
I started a Software Engineering bootcamp with Flatiron School a few weeks ago since I decided enough is enough in terms of having to settle with technical support gigs as a career. I only ever get approached for tech support jobs nowadays, which is kind of sad comparatively since I have tried so hard over the past few years to be seen as more than just my current position.
</p>

<p>
Hoping I can convince recruiters otherwise one day soon, and finally get the 'Junior Software Engineer' or 'Fullstack Engineer' job I have been dreaming about for quite some time.
</p>

<p>
In terms of coursework, it has slowly been ramping up in difficulty, but in a good way. Honestly, its been very fun to be able to learn how to really get down to the nitty gritty and just work on projects on my own. To be fair, I am actually grateful that I've learned a good majority of the background of some of the material through previous jobs, but more so by dabbling in random topics for the past few years.
</p>

<p>
I am glad I decided to do a bootcamp because learning the same material yourself is doable, but without direction, deadlines, and actual 1-on-1 help, it is that much harder to do, let alone figure out since most documentation pages on any web dev topics are really only meant for seasoned professionals. Moreso, from what I've seen on most job listings, companies won't even look at you without the Bachelor's in Computer Science or a bootcamp anyway, so it's worth a shot.
</p>

<p>
I do have some ideas on how to add more to the 'Portfolio' section of this site given what I have learned so far. However, I need slightly more time to refine what I'm thinking to actually present on this site. Shouldn't be too hard to implement as the earlier basic web apps we've made are some basic NodeJS examples using 'fetch()' via 'POST' requests with chained '.then()' blocks to send and retrieve data.
</p>

<p>
On a related note, I actually created my first pull request (PR) recently since I've been trying to tweak my Emacs config accordingly and remembered that the 'Uncle Dave Emacs' YouTube channel had a video on the 'ihsec' utility that allows you to change Emacs configs on the fly:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ihsec - Switching emacs configs on the fly! (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns0rsKrG-Mc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns0rsKrG-Mc</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>
I realized after downloading the 'ihsec' utility and poking around on the related GitHub issues page that the 'Makefile' was expanding an environment variable to an incorrect directory due to the 'SHELL' environment variable not being used. With this in mind, I forked the entire repo, made the necessary revision, and then created a related pull request:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/daedreth/ihsec/pull/12">https://github.com/daedreth/ihsec/pull/12</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Whether or not Dave actually accepts the PR is one thing, but it was really really fun to do it since I love Emacs a ton.
</p>

<p>
I also moved my own Emacs config to its own GitHub repo so that I can use 'ihsec' and swap Emacs configs on the fly:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/SamuelBanya/SamsEmacs">https://github.com/SamuelBanya/SamsEmacs</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Now I can finally test other people's Emacs configs to finally maybe fix my LSP-Mode issues with autocompletion for various programming languages :)

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb7e2d14">

I modernized both the 'Bandcamper' and 'Scripture Of The Day' projects by adding Bootstrap buttons (<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/">https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/</a>) and Bootstrap navbar items (<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/navbars/">https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/navbars/</a>) via the CSS stylesheets for both projects.
</p>

<p>
I also refactored the code for both projects a bit as well, since they were both in a bit of rough shape:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/SamuelBanya/Bandcamper">https://github.com/SamuelBanya/Bandcamper</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/SamuelBanya/ScriptureOfTheDay">https://github.com/SamuelBanya/ScriptureOfTheDay</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Overall result looks decent so far, looking forward to creating more JS heavy projects soon.
</p>

<p>
Other than doing this, I've been trying to get a working 'Navidrome' instance (<a href="https://www.navidrome.org/">https://www.navidrome.org/</a>) to host my FLAC music collection on my Dell Optiplex 7070SFF running Fedora Server, but am struggling a bit with the firewall config portion since its a headless server to begin with.
</p>

<p>
The process of adjusting the firewall will have to be done since I need to be able to access the admin page via port 4533. I don't have a window manager installed on that server, so it'll take a deep dive of the following two links to figure out how to do this via 'firewalld':
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/firewalld/#opening-ports-firewalld-fedora">https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/firewalld/#opening-ports-firewalld-fedora</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Most likely, I will have to do the following commands accordingly to open up port 4533 accordingly:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=4533/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --runtime-to-permanent
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Here's to having my own Spotify-like instance, aka Navidrome. One step closer to self-hosted LAN based server freedom :)

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org40b4847">
<p>
I did some changes throughout both of my live sites.
</p>

<p>
Here are the changes I did for the 'musimatic.xyz' tech portfolio site:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I changed the styling of this page since I'm gearing this to be more and more of a tech resume / portfolio website.</li>
<li>I revised the main CSS stylesheet so that the button transitions are nice to show off the effects I have done.</li>
<li>I also added some ASCII art as the title, which really fits the vibe of the site.</li>
<li>I revised the webring so that there is a link at the bottom that takes you to the top of the page if needed since webrings always contain a ton of links, and this helps with the discovery of new sites to explore from a new user's perspective</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here are the changes I did for the 'sambanya.com' art portfolio site:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I modified the 'ArtGalleryCreator2' project so that the sorted() function present uses the 'reverse=True' parameter value so that the latest scanned artwork is displayed first.</li>
<li>I made great strides to the 'Portfolio' section to align it with David Revoy's site's CSS stylesheet as I really like the way he did the layout for an artist site like his (though I will modify it later on to be truly my own in terms of color schemes present):</li>
<li><a href="https://www.davidrevoy.com/">https://www.davidrevoy.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
A huge note to point out that such a revision for the 'Portfolio' section of the art site, 'sambanya.com' is a giant undertaking to do, so it's not complete by any means. This will require me to create a 'PortfolioSiteCreator' project, similar to the 'ArtGalleryCreator2' project because this will need to have thumbnails automatically created for each image that I dump into a 'portfolio' image folder. This is so I don't have to manually revise this site each and every time, and like a good developer, just automate the boring stuff so you can focus on the fun things.
</p>

<p>
The 'flexbox' JS library portion of the issue is easy to implement. It's just making sure that the resulting HTML template is repeatable and scalable is a different story. However, I don't think it will take much time, but its not that big of a deal yet, so I am in no rush to complete this.
</p>

<p>
I did create an Instagram account for my artwork as well under the name of 'ShortstopGFX', but haven't uploaded anything yet, as I am deciding 'the best of the best' of everything I've done so far to post on there:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/shortstopgfx/">https://www.instagram.com/shortstopgfx/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
It mostly will be filled with pen and ink drawings, as well as pixel art that I post to scene demo parties on 'Pouet' (<a href="https://www.pouet.net/">https://www.pouet.net/</a>) most likely.
</p>

<p>
For the uninitiated, I plan on following in the footsteps of 'ProwlerGFX', since I want to do his style of pixel art later on, but I still know that it will still take time to reach this level of artwork:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.antialias.se/">https://www.antialias.se/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ProwlerGFX">https://www.youtube.com/user/ProwlerGFX</a></li>

<h2 id="org40e49a7">March 8, 2022</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org40e49a7">
<p>
I have tweaked the designs of both sites a bit further, and clearly modeled the CSS styling of the buttons from a few examples I found online:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://musimatic.xyz/">https://musimatic.xyz/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sambanya.com/">https://sambanya.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The first one is definitely looking up-to-par, and has vastly improved.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, I need to create more actual projects, but that comes with time.
</p>

<p>
Of course, that will only increase once I finish a related Typescript and Postman course, and begin figuring out how to really get more Full Stack experience to create more web apps.
</p>

<p>
I do have a few goals for the 'sambanya.com' page:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Make the portfolio landing page standout with a few nice art examples with a 'Flexbox' gallery:</li>
<li><a href="https://fancyapps.com/playground/17g">https://fancyapps.com/playground/17g</a></li>
<li>Rip the DOS style buttons from this website:</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mistys-internet.website/">https://www.mistys-internet.website/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The only thing I'm debating is the actual workflow of obtaining the images themselves again. 
</p>

<p>
I'm tempted to make an 'ArtGalleryCreator3' where it would basically rip the images and create an associated thumbnails folder to then be used to display in a grid at the bottom of the page.
</p>

<p>
However, I think the end results so far are looking good so far.

<p>
I've been in some rough shape with my back health for the past two weeks.
</p>

<p>
This means I haven't been able to work on much art, or even the synth album I was working on a bit. Kind of sucks, but that's how life is sometimes. Can't say I didn't think of great ideas in the meantime and similar webpages to copy entire styles from though.
</p>

<p>
That being said, I did some major overhauling with the two websites I run.
</p>

<p>
I moved all of my art and music to my art portfolio website:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.sambanya.com">https://www.sambanya.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I then overhauled this site to only feature web dev type projects going forward so I can present a decent portfolio going forward:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.musimatic.xyz">https://www.musimatic.xyz</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I also put embedded music players from Bandcamp and Soundcloud on the music section of my main page:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.sambanya.com/music.html">https://www.sambanya.com/music.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Overall, I probably still need to play around with the button layouts a bit more, but its good for what it is, since I literally only manage the webpages with Org docs in Emacs, and export them into HTML which makes editing them a breeze.
</p>

<p>
My goal going forward is to make the 'Web Apps' page resemble something like one of the following websites:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://aem1k.com/">https://aem1k.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://jankenpopp.com/">http://jankenpopp.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
To think, my old website for that original solo band, "The Bedside Morale", was never actually put up on the internet, but only was going to run on an Apache webserver back in 2011 or so. I have it archived somewhere on my file server. Should dig it up and host it for fun since the glossy buttons were beautiful for hte time being. On a similar note, it is absolutely crazy how easier things have become to deploy servers with since the average person could deploy even a Wordpress website in seconds without even needing to know a single line of PHP (unheard of back then).
</p>

<p>
Looking forward to deploying some real web apps with React, Django, etc. when I actually get better though. Probably will just stick with the Typescript course I was working on to completion, and then go straight for another Full Stack type course to tag along with related projects.
</p>

<p>
Here's to a better web development portfolio and a better career for the future.

Thankfully, there exists printer drivers for Linux for those printers too, so I'd be set with either one:

</ul>

<p>
Honestly, some of the best comparison videos for printers weirdly enough has been from 'crafters' on YouTube since its not that easy to figure out what would actually work with heavier paper like bristol paper.
</p>

<p>
Slowly trying to figure out what works best for my art workflow.
</p>

<p>
Results with printing on grey toned paper with colored pencils and alcohol markers has been cool, but I definitely would like to do something between 70's sci-fi art meets classic illustrators like Franklin Booth.

I am still debating the exact CSS stylesheet to use for the main art portfolio website:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.sambanya.com/">https://www.sambanya.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I am still leaning heavily towards copying the style of these three sites somehow:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://karlkopinski.com/">https://karlkopinski.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wyliebeckert.com/">https://wyliebeckert.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://davidmattingly.com/sketches/">https://davidmattingly.com/sketches/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I found this site to be useful for studying posing figures since Blender makes my old Thinkpad X230 become a furnace, so this is a nice browser based alternative:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.posemaniacs.com/">https://www.posemaniacs.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I also got lucky and found a YouTube channel that actually interviews a lot of the awesome 1970's sci-fi artists which is great since their workflow is so elusive even after heavy research.
</p>

<p>
Here are some cool highlights of videos I found:

<p>
Inspiring stuff for the most part.
</p>

<p>
In terms of Linux stuff, I tried installing Emacs on ScPup64 aka a derivative of Slacko Puppy Linux this week, and its been a mess trying to find the different dependencies present even with help on their forums.
</p>

<p>
Going to just stick with Manjaro for the time being until I can MAYBE find a Puppy or Dog Linux derivative that has Emacs 27+ by default.

<p>
It's funny how one simple change to a CSS stylesheet can make or break the effects that you're after.
</p>

<p>
Thankfully, I was able to ask the 'FancyBox' JS package about a CSS issue I had with my Art Gallery page via this GitHub issue:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/fancyapps/ui/issues/209">https://github.com/fancyapps/ui/issues/209</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
They told me that I was applying style changes too broadly to the 'img' tag in general.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, I changed the section for images in the CSS stylesheet for the 'ArtGalleryCreator2' project to be the following (Related link: <a href="https://github.com/SamuelBanya/ArtGalleryCreator2/blob/main/artgallery.css">https://github.com/SamuelBanya/ArtGalleryCreator2/blob/main/artgallery.css</a>):
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-css"><span style="color: #bc6ec5; font-weight: bold;">#right_art_gallery img </span><span style="color: #4f97d7;">{</span>
    <span style="color: #4f97d7; font-weight: bold;">padding</span>: 5px;
    <span style="color: #4f97d7; font-weight: bold;">background</span>: <span style="color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;">white</span>;
    <span style="color: #4f97d7; font-weight: bold;">border</span>: 2px solid <span style="color: #000000; background-color: #BBB;">#BBB</span>;
    <span style="color: #4f97d7; font-weight: bold;">margin</span>: 7px 14px 7px 0;
    <span style="color: #4f97d7; font-weight: bold;">width</span>: 160px;
<span style="color: #4f97d7;">}</span>

<span style="color: #bc6ec5; font-weight: bold;">#right_art_gallery img:hover </span><span style="color: #4f97d7;">{</span>
    <span style="color: #4f97d7; font-weight: bold;">border</span>: 2px solid <span style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #ff0000;">red</span>;
<span style="color: #4f97d7;">}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
By specifying the ID of the element itself, it then gets rid of the previous override.
</p>

<p>
This means that when images are viewed, it doesn't start at such a small size like the art images BEFORE you click into them.
</p>

<p>
The result is a better looking Art Gallery page upon clicking into images:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.sambanya.com/artgallery.html">https://www.sambanya.com/artgallery.html</a></li>

I was able to deploy my art portfolio website yesterday after a ton of work to get it working with the 'Epik' domain registrar, and 'Vultur' VPS provider:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.sambanya.com">https://www.sambanya.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I am in the process of migrating all my artwork to it so that I have more space for it going forward.
</p>

<p>
Is it fully functional?
</p>

<p>
No way. Not at all.
</p>

<p>
There is still a lot of work to be done, since I'm trying to figure out how to create a CSS stylesheet that will rival the following artist websites that I think look fantastic:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://karlkopinski.com/">https://karlkopinski.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wyliebeckert.com/">https://wyliebeckert.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.brucepennington.co.uk/">http://www.brucepennington.co.uk/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://turnislefthome.com/">https://turnislefthome.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://davidmattingly.com/sketches/">https://davidmattingly.com/sketches/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.mathewborrett.com/">https://www.mathewborrett.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.stephenfabian.com/gallery">https://www.stephenfabian.com/gallery</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The goal is to have a look similar to the sites above, but have as minimal JS present on the site so it doesn't become too bloated.
</p>

<p>
I might even opt for a minimalistic look as per this website that was created entirely using Emacs Org Mode since I really like the fonts being used:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://unwindprotect.com/starting-somewhere">https://unwindprotect.com/starting-somewhere</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I do plan on carrying over the same 'Art Gallery' page from this site, but I have since updated the project to become more friendly for anyone who wants to deploy the same Art Gallery but for their OWN website.
</p>

<p>
This means if you modify the '.env' file in my 'ArtGalleryCreator2' project after deploying it on your 'nginx' based website's VPS, you too can run a similar Art Gallery page that is exactly like mine, aka read the 'README.md' and you'll be fine:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/SamuelBanya/ArtGalleryCreator2">https://github.com/SamuelBanya/ArtGalleryCreator2</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Have fun hacking away at my project on your own site.
</p>

<p>
NOTE, if you are oblivious to what hacking really means, and still think hacking has some sort of negative context, read this article by Richard Stallman that goes over why hacking is what everyone should be doing to their own computers to make their lives easier:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.stallman.org/articles/on-hacking.html">https://www.stallman.org/articles/on-hacking.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
In short, every device should be hacked since you should have the freedom to do whatever you want to any device you own.
</p>

<p>
Stop treating the word 'hack' like such a bad thing.

I have been trying to figure out how to contribute to Emacs Org Mode and Puppy Linux.
</p>

<p>
In terms of my web development projects, I can't seem to get my ElectronJS project to actually produce sound on Linux, but modeling it after a similar example from GitHub, I was able to get it to work on the workbased Macbook:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/SamuelBanya/SimpleSynth">https://github.com/SamuelBanya/SimpleSynth</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
This is the project that I heavily modeled after since the docs on ElectronJS on how to actually incorporate other libraries like sound libraries (ex: synths, etc) are very limited, and there are barely any actual working examples that do this on the ElectronJS docs page:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/starakaj/tone-electron">https://github.com/starakaj/tone-electron</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I think what I've realized is that some advice from a developer at a couple jobs ago was absolutely right:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Just stick with web apps in an actual browser</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is to avoid having to support desktop apps that vary so widely on different architectures on different machines.
</p>

<p>
It's better to just have it work in a modern browser so that I can at least present the work.
</p>

<p>
Hoping to at least get it working in the next week or so, but if it doesn't, I might just host it on an actual page and move on. I don't want to spend too much time on a simple music application that doesn't work, and would rather it would 'just work'.

<p>
I have been doing a ton of artwork, and having a ton of fun as a result.
</p>

<p>
I skimmed a ton of art courses, and realized two things:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Every single teacher that tries to cover anatomy basically rips off Bridgman or Hogarth</li>
<li>Past the basics, most of these same teachers just showboat for the remaining portion of a given course with 'rendering'</li>
</ul>

<p>
With this in mind, I pretty much have just been drawing along with the Bridgman based anatomy book whenever I feel like learning more of the figure, and then will literally draw mannequin forms of action figures to further simplify poses with gesture drawings.
</p>

<p>
I even found an awesome free site that is dedicated to art reference poses which I will probably use in my workflow as well:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.posemaniacs.com/">https://www.posemaniacs.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
My current workflow for illustrations includes the following:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Scan in ink drawings into GIMP at the end of the month for all the ink drawings I did</li>
<li>When I'm ready to work on the image, open the .png, and then nuke the white background and bump up the levels to make every black pixel on the screen to be fully black</li>
<li>Export the resulting .png from GIMP, and open it in Krita to work on as a digital illustration</li>
<li>Once I'm done with the illustration, I can then resize the illustration to something of a super low resolution like 256 pixels in width, and then force the colors to be 16 bits for an indexed palette which pretty much converts it into pixel art</li>
<li>Open up the resulting image in Grafx2 to complete the pixel art image</li>
</ul>

<p>
Though the last point doesn't guarantee a perfect pixel art image, it gets pretty close to what I want.
</p>

<p>
What I have found is that working on multiple pieces throughout a given week is actually kind of fun and rewarding.
</p>

<p>
It really goes to show you the amount of work it takes to really pull off a good illustration, and lets you have a window into what you want to actually work on in that given day. 
</p>

<p>
There were days when I just wanted to work on background lighting for an illustration, vs. other days when I wanted to apply painterly type ideas to a given figure's form.
</p>

<p>
I have also come to realize that digital art itself requires so many different masking layers in order to really pull off some cool effects.
</p>

<p>
This particular video on how to do this in 'Krita' was VERY rewarding in this respect:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Krita 4.4.3 tutorial - clone layers, filter masks, transform masks (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VratqYiarc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VratqYiarc</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>
In terms of the artwork on this site, I've realized a few things:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I will probably need to host a completely separate website for my artwork if I want to continue on the digital realm of art</li>
<li>This is because the file sizes even for the .png's alone are pretty dang big</li>
</ul>

<p>
Luckily, there DOES exist some options but it will cost extra money to pull it off so here's my research what I did so far on this topic from my notes:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.epik.com">https://www.epik.com</a> has 'sambanya.art' available for $15 a year:</li>
<li>There exists two options on 'Vultr' for a VPS that could run the specs of a site like this:</li>

<div id="outline-container-orga834d9e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga834d9e">December 29, 2021</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga834d9e">
<p>
I re-uploaded my developer projects back to GitHub:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/SamuelBanya?tab=repositories">https://github.com/SamuelBanya?tab=repositories</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Reason being is that I wanted to distro-hop on my personal machines (laptop, Desktop, etc) like a mad man to check out some other workflows, though mostly because I think Thunar file manager's bug in XFCE desktop on Manjaro desktop that automatically mounts SD cards as 'root' is crazy hence I'm switching out to something better.
</p>

<p>
The less I have to actually depend upon existing on the file system for a given laptop or Desktop via a different Linux distro .iso used in 'Ventoy', the better.
</p>

<p>
This will save me some time since I keep having to re-deploy a laptop like my Thinkpad X230 each time I change my setup, so I'd rather just offload stuff to either GitHub, or my file server.
</p>

<p>
Really, I'm just aiming for something a bit more simple and hands off going forward.
</p>

<p>
I'm aiming to play around with Puppy Linux to make an Emacs specific Operating System, since I don't see too many Puppy Linux derivatives that give you a decent Emacs config from the get-go.
</p>

<p>
On the art side of things, I finished most of the Watts Atelier art course. Learned a ton, but man does that guy like to talk too much. Dude's got respectable skill though, and I definitely will use the course PDF handouts later as a reference.
</p>

<p>
I've been going through the 'Meds Map' from Ahmed Aldoori (<a href="https://medsmap.mykajabi.com/landing-page">https://medsmap.mykajabi.com/landing-page</a>). Probably one of the best digital art courses I've sifted through in a while.
</p>

<p>
Other than that, I've completed a few digital art illustrations, and am working on getting my workflow between GIMP, Krita, and Grafx2 down pat. 
</p>

<p>
I do plan on scanning stuff in, but it always take a ton of time just to get some images scanned in the first place.
</p>

<p>
But, I've since turned away from using sketchbooks for this reason, and literally just draw on printer paper to make the scanning process 100x easier. Plus, printer paper looks awesome with ink anyway.
</p>

<p>
My current art workflow includes the following:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Scan in an ink drawing at 300 DPI with GIMP with the 'SANE' scanner plugin that you can install on any Linux distro</li>
<li>Open the same drawing in GIMP, and remove the white layer to create a transparent .png</li>
<li>Bring the same transparent .png into Krita to then lower the opacity to 80%, and to then create a pencil layer ontop</li>
<li>Print the progress, re-ink the printed ink drawing, and re-scan it as a new layer with 'Multiply'</li>
<li>Use a new layer on the layer below and fill in the color with a round hard brush in Krita</li>
<li>Once it looks completed, save it, and then re-scale a different copy with 256 pixels at its width</li>
<li>Re-index the painting to ONLY 16 colors</li>
<li>The result is a cool looking pixel art piece, but which can still be brought into Grafx2 for further dithering</li>
</ul>

<p>
So far, the results have been pretty sweet. However, I'm still trying to figure out which specific demoscene parties to upload my work to since there are ton still going on these days at these sites:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.pouet.net/">https://www.pouet.net/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://demozoo.org/">https://demozoo.org/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://16colo.rs/">https://16colo.rs/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I've already decided on an alias for my new work, which will be 'Shortstop' for a few reasons:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Funnily enough, I actually don't like baseball much at all, so there's some irony already present</li>
<li>However, I do consider myself to be an alright mediator, hence the name</li>
<li>Kinda fits my personality already</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now to make my pixel art pieces more known :)
</p>

<p>
I don't plan on posting my pixel art on this site either because of the overhead, and plus, no one really cares to go to Joe Schmoe's personal site for that kind of thing.
</p>

<p>
It's just expected to be on those platform sites above, so I think I have a better shot on those instead.
</p>

<p>
Regarding music, I also thought a bit deeply about the instruments I currently play aka synth and guitar, and even though I've relegated them to just on the weekend to devote more time to art, I think my main goal going forward is to at least always create every time I sit down and 'practice' or 'play'.
</p>

<p>
Reason being is that I'm kind of sick of the 'maintenance' mode of playing that comes with playing instruments, ex: Playing old songs so I can remember them etc.
</p>

<p>
I'm really only interested in creating new things going forward.
</p>

<p>
Career-wise, I'm shooting for getting both my documentation skills and web development skills up to par. I plan on focusing on Typescript first as this is heavily used for most frameworks anyway, and serves as the foundation for things like NodeJS, Electron, React, etc.
</p>

<p>
Sure, you might get your job automated later in the future as a documentation based technical writer, but that track still might teach me the right skills to make commits on larger project repositories. 
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, you never see anyone saying that there is perfect documentation out there, only the lack thereof.
</p>

<p>
Luckily, work has been really cool with allowing me to gain some related skills by allowing for some work based GitHub projects, and the opportunity to also edit the related documentation as well.
</p>

<p>
Might help out Puppy Linux, Emacs Org Mode, or some kind of emulators. Not sure yet, but documentation's a good place to start no matter what project it is.
</p>

<p>
There's even a cool Hungarian based Puppy Linux page that might be worth checking out to help out, who knows:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://skamilinux.hu/">https://skamilinux.hu/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Might give me some cool translation skills for Hungarian as well since the dude who runs the site writes the entire page in Hungarian and is into pretty much the same things I am into for the most part.
</p>

<p>
Whatever it takes, I'll make it happen :)

I was able to complete all of the tasks I had assigned myself this entire year.
</p>

<p>
This is saying something because I'm a pretty motivated person, and am surprised I got through all of those tasks. Seriously.
</p>

<p>
Recently, I got the following tasks complete:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Pretty much almost sold the old Odroid HC-4 I bought since it was such a hassle to figure out how to setup with Open Media Vault &#x2013;&gt; Don't buy one, just don't. They are a waste of time, and there are better SBC's out there for this kind of thing.</li>
<li>Got 'Ventoy' (<a href="https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html">https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html</a>) to work with a spare 1TB external HDD to add a ton of cool Linux Live DVD ISOs to try out</li>
<li>Installed Open Media Vault on a spare 128GB USB Flash Drive to basically turn my old Desktop into a mega, multi-HDD SAMBA machine</li>
<li>Completely hacked the Nintendo Switch I had laying around with up-to-date GitHub patches, which is awesome</li>
<li>Made a slew of work based projects on the work-based GitHub account, and have plans to put more of my own projects on my personal GitHub</li>
<li>Going through most of the 'Watts Atelier' art course videos, which has been pretty good</li>
<li>Completed a 'Haynes MK1-2K16' synth kit to build a functional monophonic synth</li>
<li>Completed the guitar build kit from Fretwire.com, which still needs the neck to be secured in, and the bridge to be fastened</li>
<li>Getting into figuring out how to do Demoscene art, which will be mega fun to do with 'Grafx2'</li>
<li>Installed 'Manjaro' Linux on my Thinkpad X230 as well, since I previously only had it on my Desktop spare HDD</li>
<li>Converted my old Raspberry Pi 3B+ into a SAMBA share with 'psx-pi' which now serves Sony PS2 games DIRECTLY to my slim Sony PS2 via ethernet, which is amazing</li>
<li>Got both Anbernic 'RG351MP' and 'RG351V' handheld devices, and put '351Elec' ('https://351elec.de/') on them both to make them into emulation powerhouse machines. Very fun devices to have around, and man, the form factor as well as the aspect ratios are on point!</li>
<li>Learned how to transfer saves from Virtual Console games from the 3DS to extract the '.dat' files to just rename them to .srm files for later use in Retroarch on the Anbernic handhelds I got, and the saves transferred beautifully</li>
<li>Finally swapped out the 2032 CMOS clock battery in the Dell Optiplex file server I have since it never remembered the correct boot option to boot properly into 'Fedora Server' without a new one</li>
</ul>

<p>
Other than this, I plan on making more digital art illustrations going forward. I have shifted my mentality to really train on the fundamentals Mon to Wed, and just have fun with it for the rest of the week.
</p>

<p>
I might also try hosting a 'BBS' on a spare machine, specifically on a 'VM' within 'Cockpit' on 'Fedora'. Maybe that or a slew of game servers in some VPS instances.
</p>

<p>
The only other thing I could think of is to maybe get 'Batocera' working on a spare USB flash drive or something. Might convert over to Puppy Linux via a USB flash drive if I get bored of Manjaro though.
</p>

<p>
As long as Emacs works on any distro I'm on, I'm good :)
</p>

<p>
Overall, a decent end to the year.
</p>

<h2 id="orgf82ccfe">November 19, 2021</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf82ccfe">
<p>
I added some older projects to the 'git.musimatic.xyz' site, specifically under an 'Archive' repo:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://git.musimatic.xyz/Archive/tree/">https://git.musimatic.xyz/Archive/tree/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I also open sourced my projects running on crontab jobs on this site as well:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://git.musimatic.xyz/ArtGalleryCreator/tree/">https://git.musimatic.xyz/ArtGalleryCreator/tree/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://git.musimatic.xyz/Bandcamper/tree/">https://git.musimatic.xyz/Bandcamper/tree/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://git.musimatic.xyz/ScriptureOfTheDay/tree/">https://git.musimatic.xyz/ScriptureOfTheDay/tree/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://git.musimatic.xyz/RandomCSSColorGenerator/tree/">https://git.musimatic.xyz/RandomCSSColorGenerator/tree/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
For my new job, I've been working on making 'hello world' typo repos as well as some basic GUI type program examples for the team
to learn from. Reason being is that I have to deal with a variety of programming languages to assist Dev's on a daily basis, so
I wanted to know how the very basics of the following languages at the bare minimum:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Python</li>
<li>Java (Maven, Gradle)</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>DotNet (C#)</li>
<li>JS (NodeJS)</li>
<li>Elixir</li>
</ul>

<p>
I've shifted to primarily doing some skill-building work-based tasks in the beginning half of a given week (Mon to Wed) and then 
just doing my own thing towards the end of a given week Thursday onward. It has done wonders for my mental health, and would 
recommend anyone else to do the same if possible if they're trying to move their careers forward, but somehow balance it all.
Life is kind of insane these days, so its good to keep it in check if you can, God willing.
</p>

<p>
Other than that, I hacked a PS4 the other week, and the older Nintendo Switch I had laying around. However, more so, I got an 
RCM Loader device which allows me to apply CFW (Custom Firmware) without needing to plug the Switch into a computer, which is 
really nice and convenient since it's kind of a pain to load any form of 'Tegra' using Linux. Now if only I could get 
'Gold Leaf' to work properly (probably through related but obscure GitHub patches), that would be cool too.
</p>

<p>
Been primarily working on ink drawing when I can though. Might contribute to Emacs Org Mode though one of these days, as
I'm looking for the PR commit experience :)
</p>

<p>
Planning on getting an Odroid soon to get a good SAMBA share drive going so I can easily access the ton of art resources I have
on a 4TB drive laying around:

<li><a href="https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-hc4/">https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-hc4/</a></li>

<p>
Related YouTube video which showcases it, and got me interested, as I was kind of getting sick of my Dell Optiplex file server
setup I currently have since its a bit bulky. It even supports "Wake On LAN" with magic packets which is sick:

Planning to do a synth based third album later on. Probably will involve using 'JACK' via 'qjackctl' with multiple input 
configurations between synths, drum machines, and lots of samples with loops. Should be a lot of fun.

I was able to finally re-design the Art Gallery to incorporate the 'FancyBox' JS library, which makes it SUPER easy to view any
images on the page.
</p>

<p>
Related link for the 'FancyBox' library:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://fancyapps.com/docs/ui/installation">https://fancyapps.com/docs/ui/installation</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I specifically modeled it after this example that they provided:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://fancyapps.com/playground/vl">https://fancyapps.com/playground/vl</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
This is the end result: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://musimatic.xyz/pythonprojectwebsites/ArtGallery/artgallery.html">https://musimatic.xyz/pythonprojectwebsites/ArtGallery/artgallery.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Also, I was able to re-design the main site, and also scrape random palettes from 'Lospec'('https://lospec.com/') and also 
determine if the background and foreground palette colors were light or dark based upon a few random posts and articles. The 
end result is that the page reaches out to flip a coin to change its color scheme every minute, which is pretty a cool idea
on my part. Here are the resources I used as reference materials:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.codespeedy.com/convert-rgb-to-hex-color-code-in-python/">https://www.codespeedy.com/convert-rgb-to-hex-color-code-in-python/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22603510/is-this-possible-to-detect-a-colour-is-a-light-or-dark-colour">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22603510/is-this-possible-to-detect-a-colour-is-a-light-or-dark-colour</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
These are the few sites I ripped off in terms of styling ideas:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://antialias.se/">https://antialias.se/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://newsboat.org/">https://newsboat.org/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://vimm.net/">https://vimm.net/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I was also able to add a random artwork using portions of my 'Art Gallery Creator' project's code as well, and incorporated
the idea of using a transparent background using this random post I found:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/nbVg4/4/">https://jsfiddle.net/nbVg4/4/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The Art Gallery page was created via my project named 'ArtGalleryCreator', which is an art gallery page that literally 
creates itself.
</p>

<p>
Here's the RandomCSSColorGenerator' project which is my Python 3 project which rips color schemes from the Lospec website
('https://lospec.com/'):

Been going through Greg Vilppu's drawing courses, and learned a bit of figure drawing.
</p>

<p>
However, I will have to really go through his anatomy courses to figure out more in depth on how to actually draw the head,
torso, arms, legs, etc. This is more so because that particular teacher knows his anatomy inside and out so its kind of 
hard to follow along when I've been guessing, since its been so long since I ever took an anatomy course anyway.
</p>

<p>
I uploaded my newer sketchbook on the 'Art Gallery' page as well, and some of the results are pretty good. I even uploaded
older art as well, and let's just say, most of it is not that great, but I guess there's some progress to be made.
My goal is to eventualy make some cool concept art, and do some lithography via linocuts, etc, and eventually oil paintings.
</p>

<p>
Art really has been helping me deal with stress these days, more so than playing guitar or keys ever did. Though, I did take
a more refined approach to keys recently, and have been going through the Hanon and Czerny exercises which have helped a lot.
Also, I've been just focusing on literally one song a week and haven't been rehearsing anything else to just get stuff up to
90 BPM and moving on. This is more so since I don't have much time for it in the morning, but its something I do right before
work, and something to still look forward to these days.
</p>

<p>
I have been working on that second JeeveSobs album as well, and the songs are pretty much done. I just have to mix, and master
it and it should be just fine. Overall, still guitar heavy, but I'm planning to mix it like some kind of Pinback album.
</p>

<p>
I should get back into my guitar building project too as well soon since I still need to apply clear coat to the guitar itself. 
</p>

<p>
Maybe next weekend, we'll see.

I spoke too soon.
</p>

<p>
That self-creating art gallery page was great, but the amount of images, and the default sizes are CRAZY big.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, I had to incorporate creating thumbnails into the logical process as well.
</p>

<p>
I tried many, many, many different attempts to resize the GIF's without success.
</p>

<p>
I have no idea how to resize the GIF's. I tried the 'resize2gif' library, and even tried to follow two vague Stackoverflow
posts to manually hack the module's code to work with Python 3 without matrix array errors. Ultimately, its not worth the
hassle. 
</p>

<p>
I'll just have to figure out the GIF's portion section another time.
</p>

<p>
Most likely, I will have to take the first frame of a given GIF, save that as an image, and then repeat the process of
creating thumbnails from those images.

Hard work pays off.
</p>

<p>
Though the CSS styling for this page is far from complete and needs a lot of work, the idea is fulfilled:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.musimatic.xyz/pythonprojectwebsites/ArtGallery/artgallery.html">https://www.musimatic.xyz/pythonprojectwebsites/ArtGallery/artgallery.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Basically, I created an entire art gallery page that creates itself.
</p>

<p>
How it works:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A Python 3 script creates the page by iterating through the related image directory on the site, and creates an HTML page.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you like Python 3, and source code, well, this is for you, since this is how I did it so you can do it on your site
as well:

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5026d7d">

I found a few art gallery pages worth stealing design ideas from, which include William L. Eaken's illustration page:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://eaken.net/illustration_index.html">http://eaken.net/illustration_index.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Love the layout, how each thumbnail reveals a corresponding page. I could probably accomplish this but would have to create automatically
generated pages for each and every artwork I have. No way would I do this by hand, but its definitely possible with a CronTab job Python 3 script though.
</p>

<p>
Just thinking of some good layouts to replace the art gallery page with, aka here's my current work in progress using the "CSS Grid Layout", though
I would much rather a left sidebar. Will have to rework it a bit, and also make it just somehow have two columns, one for the menu, the second column
for the rest of the content, aka time to revisit CSS styling ideas I barely remember, fun times:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://musimatic.xyz/artgallery.html">https://musimatic.xyz/artgallery.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Might steal the entire design of this site as well, we'll see:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990424125043/http://www.dosgames.com:80/">https://web.archive.org/web/19990424125043/http://www.dosgames.com:80/</a></li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb2e6eb7">
<p>
I have failed a lot in quite a few projects lately. 
</p>

<p>
So, ultimately, this is a message more so on how to fail, and more or less how to accept it.
</p>

<p>
Things I have failed at for the past month:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I just can't figure out how to get Emacs Tramp Mode to work for 'gcp' boxes for work to make my work life easier.</li>
<li>My artwork-based WordPress site just wouldn't work due to the "White Screen Of Death" issue, despite so many attempts to fix it so I nuked it.</li>
<li>I tried to to use "PrivateInternetAccess" VPN on a headless Fedora Server which ended up not working at all, but did allow me to request a complete refund.</li>
</ul>

<p>
However, there are a few takeaways that were positive, and DID work out:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I tweaked my Emacs config heavily for work to improve a few things (discover-my-major, log4j, multiple-cursors, aggressive-indent, SX-Mode, counsel-grep-or-swiper, csv-mode, dockerfile-mode, docker-compose-mode, webpaste.el, docker.el)</li>
<li>I got the cable management in my office room to where I want it, with plans to move the desktop to the other wall with keyboard stands for the synths.</li>
<li>I was able to make toltott kaposzta (Hungarian stuffed cabbage), and goulash for the first time in the last month, and they came out great comparatively.</li>
<li>I've installed Manjaro Linux on my second SSD on my Desktop computer to utilize for KVM virtual machines.</li>
<li>I setup Retroarch with DOSBox Pure on the Devuan Desktop HDD, and its been fun chilling out with old school DOS games every once in a while.</li>
<li>I've learned some basics of Blender for 3D modeling so that I can get good reference models for art projects.</li>
<li>I bought an LDAP reference book (Understanding and Deploying LDAP Directory Services) and the Networking All-In-One Dummies books as references for work.</li>
<li>I learned how to use Elfeed for RSS feeds in Emacs as an alternative to Newsboat.</li>
<li>I'm slowly working on painting my Fretwire kit guitar over time.</li>
<li>I finished making the Dell Optiplex from eBay into a Fedora Server file server and Git server.</li>
<li>I figured out how to deploy SAMBA on the same Dell Optiplex to host PS2 games over ethernet that I can play via the hacked PS2.</li>
<li>I updated the Webring with quite a few more links (<a href="https://musimatic.xyz/webring.html">https://musimatic.xyz/webring.html</a>)</li>
<li>I am pretty much down to a short list of 4 things I'd still like to do, which is crazy compared to the giant list I've had this year</li>
</ul>

<p>
What I'd like to do:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Deploy a minimal artwork gallery page, preferably with thumbnails (something like this: <a href="https://sibylleszaggarsredford.com/gallery-simple-thumbnail-page/">https://sibylleszaggarsredford.com/gallery-simple-thumbnail-page/</a>)</li>
<li>I might also have to utilize some JS or a crontab job to pull of the art gallery page correctly (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28778048/get-image-from-json-file-using-javascript-and-display-in-html-img-tag">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28778048/get-image-from-json-file-using-javascript-and-display-in-html-img-tag</a>)</li>
<li>Or, I might have to use 'lxml' Python 3 library to pull in images successfully (<a href="https://lxml.de/lxmlhtml.html">https://lxml.de/lxmlhtml.html</a>)</li>
<li>More importantly, the related WIP progress for the newer art gallery page will be found here: <a href="https://www.musimatic.xyz/artgallery.html">https://www.musimatic.xyz/artgallery.html</a></li>
<li>Figure out how to incorporate Grafx2 and Blender together with a good scanner workflow for an improved art workflow.</li>
<li>Make plans to revisit the idea to deploy my own mail server idea in probably 6 months from now once I'm better with networking concepts.</li>
</ul>

<p>
What I've learned through an entire year of documenting projects:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ultimately, I'm an ideas guy at heart, and am weirdly over-technical on things that probably shouldn't be.</li>
<li>I'm also an art and music type guy, and should be doing things more focused towards that at the end of the day.</li>
<li>I follow through projects, even if they fail, and am good at documenting the journey.</li>
<li>Somehow, I will use this as an advantage in my later career if I ever grow past doing tech support.</li>
<li>I am looking forward to the day when I can combine all my interests into one career.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here's a cool video that blew my mind a few weeks ago, and has had me thinking differently on how to really incorporate art into projects:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Creative Computation – Jack Rusher (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeXCvh5X5w0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeXCvh5X5w0</a>)</li>

<h2 id="orgbfddc7f">June 6, 2021</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbfddc7f">
<p>
I forgot to mention this, but the other day, I fixed the 'w3mBookmarkSorter' so that it now is able to take a user's config file,
read it, and then determine where their given w3m related 'bookmarks.html' file is so that it can sort it alphabetically:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://git.musimatic.xyz/w3mBookmarkSorter/">https://git.musimatic.xyz/w3mBookmarkSorter/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
This is an important utility in my opinion since w3m lacks the functionality to sort bookmarks in this fashion.
</p>

<p>
I might consider joining their mailing list and just asking them to consider adding my project directly into w3m because I know
the last time I had asked about how to contribute to the Debian part of w3m, I was told it basically takes forever for 
something to get approved.
</p>

<p>
I spent a bit of time over the last two days, but I was able to get the Dell Optiplex 7010 SFF machine up and running as a server,
specifically for backups and as a Git server. I chose to run Fedora Server on it, since I've been using that for my Linux laptop,
and its pretty decent.
</p>

The only weird issue so far is that it doesn't remember the BIOS settings to specifically boot into UEFI Mode to select the USB
harddrive containing Fedora Server, so that's been annoying. I'm not sure what I can do in that regards. It most likely is
an issue with the motherboard related battery burning out or something. I can't think of any other reason why the BIOS settings
are never remembered.
</p>

<p>
On the art side of things, I spent some time scanning in an old sketchbook from 2020 / 2021, so I plan on deploying a Wordpress
site to house a 2021 based art gallery within a few weeks or a month. Let's just say I'm glad I don't do art in pencil that much
anymore as its way too annoying of a medium to begin with, especially when scanning.
</p>

<p>
Pretty happy with the way things are going, and always thinking of new fun projects.

I changed jobs recently, and am now working for a cybersecurity firm as a Technical Support Engineer.
</p>

<p>
The job itself is really interesting, and the product itself is really neat. It's a lot to learn, but I think I'm ready at this
point of my life. Let's just say I spent the last week learning how to use a Mac, and figuring out how to get the best version
of Emacs up and running for my daily note taking, which in itself, wasn't too easy. Though the MacPorts version is better than
the Brew install version, I'm still running into this weird zoom issue comparatively, but as always, its nothing that a good
change to the Emacs config can't work out.
</p>

<p>
I have been working on deploying my own email address via a Vultur VM with OpenBSD, so that's been a new experience in itself.
Never used any of the BSDs before so it was pretty interesting how the default 'ksh' Korn Shell works.
</p>

<p>
I fixed the "Pizzatime" Wordpress site, so now images appear as they should on posts due to an annoying permissions issue I was
encountering. This means that I can continue to create more pizzas as I have some crazy fusion food ideas in mind:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://pizzatime.musimatic.xyz/">https://pizzatime.musimatic.xyz/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
With this in mind, I probably will work on deploying an 2021 based art gallery as a separate Wordpress site, as well as an
"Inconsolation" ripoff site that forces me to use Debian purely in a Getty based TTY shell, which will be enlightening to say
the least, and will probably put so-called "Linux minimalists" who still boot into X11 with cringy window managers like
'DWM' to shame.
</p>

<p>
I switched over to Fedora Server Linux, which is awesome in itself. Its like a better Debian with more up-to-date packages, 
plus the installation process is a breeze compared to Gentoo. Gentoo was cool, but I don't really want to modify kernel configs 
just for my daily laptop usage. I would come back to Gentoo on an older machine that needed it for pure optimization but the 
time spent on trying to get things up and running is such a time sink. People who insist upon Gentoo, and Arch, etc, don't have 
normal day jobs and or other important time commitments. Otherwise, I just don't see how you could fathom spending 5+ hours to 
figure out how to actually get it working without tapping into IRC. Sure, you learn a lot, but man, sometimes I kind of wish I 
got the time back just so I can work on better projects instead.
</p>

<p>
I basically use all my machines like Emacs machines these days so whatever gets me going to keep my workflow improved is what
wins. No editor comes close (okay, maybe Spacemacs but yeah that's an exception since I do like Vim and Emacs equally).
</p>

<p>
I created a server rack using the IKEA Lack Rack trick, see this video for reference as its super easy and cheap to do:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>€25 CHEAP IKEA DIY Server Rack (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARkn_VHzFQg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARkn_VHzFQg</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>
I bought an old Dell Optiplex 7010 SFF on eBay to rescue an older machine. What I didn't realize is that I can only really put
a 2.5" inch and a 3.5" HDD in there, so I plan on just using a WD RED drive for the 3.5" drive, and a standard consumer grade
Seagate drive for the 2.5" drive. To be consisent, I'm also planning on putting Fedora Server on that machine as well as I'm
only going to use it for backup purposes and possibly a Git server.
</p>

<p>
I'm still in the process of doing a ton of cable management for the home office room, but have a while to go as I'm debating
if I should get 2 monitors or an ultra-wide monitor instead for both work AND my personal Desktop machine as well. Yeah, I
might turn into that guy who has like 4 monitors per machine, but hey, one step at a time.
</p>

<p>
I plan on figuring out how to use the FreeMCBoot memory card I bought for my old PS2 a few weeks ago as well, and accessing 
games via a local SAMBA share (most likely via the Dell Optiplex). Its crazy cool to see how far PS2 modding has come along.
</p>

<p>
I'm planning on building the guitar kit I bought from "TheFretwire.com". Its gonna be cool with a purple blueberry
burst ink finish. Just have to sand it in the driveway first one of these weekends and apply individual coats of the ink at a 
time. Might make a corresponding Wordpress site if I get in the habit of building more guitars.
</p>

<p>
And I've taken up a bit of gardening but let's just say I think I've overwatered the plants a bit and have learned my lesson :/
</p>

<p>
What's funny is that the soil that did land on the ground did start to sprout some of the things I planted, so here's to 
re-planting :)

It took a lot of effort and some research, but I was able to get the 'weather' page working again, as I had realized that the National Weather
Service moved their Apache server hence why my weather radar GIFs that I ripped using 'wget' weren't working for a while.
</p>

<p>
They replace their main page with some dumb bloated web app, but luckily you CAN find the related weather radar GIFs if you look hard enough.
</p>

<p>
For example, if you wanted to look up a New York City based weather radar GIF, you have to instead look for a local forecast here:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.weather.gov/okx/">https://www.weather.gov/okx/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
You then can right-click the image itself, and view it in a separate tab:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><img src="https://radar.weather.gov/ridge/lite/KOKX_loop.gif" alt="KOKX_loop.gif" /></li>
</ul>

<p>
If you go up a level, you can try to find your area:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://radar.weather.gov/ridge/lite">https://radar.weather.gov/ridge/lite</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
However, the easier approach is just to find your local area first with a normal GUI browser, and then rip the GIF accordingly. This is
because I think they name these radar images based on the weather station they're obtaining it from, or the local airport with a weather
radar, etc.
</p>

<p>
I had to do this for each of the weather pages:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.weather.gov/okx/">https://www.weather.gov/okx/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.weather.gov/ohx/">https://www.weather.gov/ohx/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.weather.gov/bgm/">https://www.weather.gov/bgm/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.weather.gov/tbw/">https://www.weather.gov/tbw/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The end result can be seen here:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.musimatic.xyz/weather.html">https://www.musimatic.xyz/weather.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
For fun, I also added cloud coverage based GIFs from NOA's GOES Image Viewer page too:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/GOES/index.php">https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/GOES/index.php</a></li>

I revamped my VPS and Raspberry Pi within the last couple of days.
</p>

<p>
Also, I added a random crontab job that changes the color scheme of the front page every 5 minutes for fun. The
results are cool, and here to stay. Might even make it more wacky with some interesting background images, who 
knows.
</p>

<p>
I did some deep thinking and yeah, I'm not gonna host any bloated web apps on the site since I really feel like
I just don't want to showcase any more bloat on the web anymore. However, I might make some cool useful 
autogenerated pages though, as I have a few more ideas up my sleeve.
</p>

<p>
Still working on that JeeveSobs album, but mostly just mixing at this point. Debating putting it on cassette tape
for a limited release of like 10 to 20 tapes max. Will need a tape deck from eBay though, but it'll be a cool 
thing to learn, and I already have the album design done anyway.
</p>

<p>
I modded my Nintendo Switch as well, and its pretty neat, though I don't often play games that much anymore. 
I've been more focused on just knocking out some life based todo list stuff in terms of goals, and have
felt a lot more well-rounded.
</p>

<p>
I've been practicing guitar once a day again instead of just the weekends, and honestly, its been a blast.
It's like I never stopped years ago, and I've been just going over what the best teacher (Pebber Brown) has
to offer on his YouTube video playlist, which is here for reference:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEqYBfzShVw&amp;list=UUbA-Tt8ELg8v0d7RdieeZyA&amp;index=564">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEqYBfzShVw&amp;list=UUbA-Tt8ELg8v0d7RdieeZyA&amp;index=564</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I've been itching to make my own guitar from parts, so I might do this with a premade double-cut guitar body
with a pre-made neck, and figure out how to spraypaint it, etc.
</p>

<p>
I've been slowly becoming more interested in the Amiga itself. In terms of Amiga OS variants, I found quite a 
few, which are showcased in the following links:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"AROS" which is the "Amiga Replacement OS"</li>
<li><a href="https://aros.sourceforge.io/pictures/screenshots/">https://aros.sourceforge.io/pictures/screenshots/</a></li>

</ul>

<p>
I've been debating what Linux distro to use instead of Gentoo because I kind of find the whole kernel updating 
process a bit annoying. I'm not sure, but something about it doesn't excite me really. I kind of want the OS to 
be minimal, dependable, and NOT to be Windoze or Mac. Also, waiting for compilation of packages doesn't really 
help either. Might change to Slackware instead, but have been looking for Gentoo derivatives for the time being.
</p>

<p>
Here's what I found:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Gentoo Studio (I really like how so much is included in terms of audio DAW stuff, would totally put this on the Desktop)</li>
<li><a href="https://gentoostudio.org/">https://gentoostudio.org/</a></li>
<li>CloverOS</li>
<li><a href="https://gitgud.io/cloveros/cloveros#what-is-cloveros">https://gitgud.io/cloveros/cloveros#what-is-cloveros</a></li>
<li>Funtoo</li>
<li><a href="https://www.funtoo.org/Welcome">https://www.funtoo.org/Welcome</a></li>
<li>Redcore Linux (Looks a bit try-hard, or weird, but I like what it aims to do)</li>
<li><a href="https://redcorelinux.org/">https://redcorelinux.org/</a></li>
<li>Sabayon Linux</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sabayon.org/">https://www.sabayon.org/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
In terms of my desktop computer, I tried adding this cool Macintosh theme to my "Just Werks" Devuan desktop, but the theme just didn't work 
right, even with MATE desktop:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://b00merang.weeby.com/system-4.html">https://b00merang.weeby.com/system-4.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
At this point, I might just keep using JUST LxQT desktop with Openbox and focus on that since it can do tiling window management if needed.
</p>

<p>
I've decided on a couple of good email server names, so I might deploy that within the next couple of months since I really would love
to host my own email. I kind of got fed up with proprietary ones like MS Outlook or Yahoo! always complaining when I use the UBlock Origin
extension (<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/</a>) to block tons of ads. This just makes it all the more 
important to just take out those service providers from my workflow since if they're basically selling all my data just for a "free" service,
they're just not worth it.

I have been mostly tweaking my Emacs configuration for the past couple of weeks, both on my personal config and
my work-based config.
</p>

<p>
Let me tell you, it is awesome to be able to utilize Emacs Window Manager inside a VM, along with 'magit-mode' for
git commits, and just all of the small tweaks I've added after watching all of Uncle Dave's Emacs videos.
</p>

<p>
I think I will blow some people's minds at work once my full setup is complete so that I can maybe get them to
possibly use it too (though&#x2026; I doubt it, but one can hope I guess).
</p>

<p>
I'll be happy when I get work email, as well as access to both ZenDesk API and JIRA Mode enabled so I can have
a full-fledged setup present.
</p>

<p>
His Emacs video playlist can be found here:

</ul>

<p>
I can say without a doubt, that my efficient for work has improved 10x with some of the things I added.
</p>

<p>
I added a ton of games to my 3DS via some cool Virtual Console injector sites that host QR codes for downloads.
</p>

<p>
<b>Here are some tweaks I made to the site:</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I also tweaked the recipes on this site to be a bit better to use, as they weren't being rendered properly.</li>
<li>I increased the font-size for the "blog" page to '20px' to be more readable.</li>
<li>I also increased the font-size for the main homepage as well to be more readable.</li>
<li>I tried re-designing the front page's styling to be a bit more simple, but I'll have to keep thinking on how to make it more usable.</li>
<li>I stole the Dark Theme from some GitHub Gist page for my 'git.musimatic.net' site (<a href="https://gist.github.com/Yoplitein/f4b671a2ec70c9e743fa">https://gist.github.com/Yoplitein/f4b671a2ec70c9e743fa</a>).</li>
<li>I made the art present on the 'art.html' page look more consistent in terms of the sizes of the images present.</li>
<li>I removed the lingering Bootstrap CSS styling present from the 'music.html' page.</li>
<li>I added 'BACK TO HOMEPAGE' hyperlinks on each of the pages.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Regarding the recipe-based rendering issue, I do blame some of the recipes themselves. Some of them either 
dragged on and rambled when a real recipe should instead only be directions. Nothing makes me more annoyed 
these days than having to sift through a giant blog post in order to get a food recipe, though I've learned 
most of these annoying types of sites usually has the recipe at the bottom anyway, so its a 50/50 I guess.
</p>

<p>
I plan on re-doing my CV instead to be in 'Org-Mode' and NOT LaTeK because LaTeX is bloated, and unnecessary.
I will find it hilarious if I can make it look 100x better than some Vim user with the bloated LaTeX install.
Sure, Emacs is bloated in its own way, but its tailored to my taste. That's what makes it awesome and function
so well as it integrates so nicely with itself. More so, the final point is that I don't HAVE to learn LaTeK
to produce a nice looking resume to be exported in PDF, or even an HTML site, with a few keyindings in Emacs 
Org-Mode :).
</p>

<p>
I've been reading Steve Howe's autobiography as I've been on a reading kick again. Autobiography books are great. 
There's really nothing else like it, and I've only did nothing BUT learn from other people's lives.
</p>

<p>
I plan on reading the one from Bill Bruford too sometime as well. Maybe even the one from Gretzky too, why not.
</p>

<p>
I bought some cables and adapters to hook up my Baofeng UV-5R to 'svxlink' which is basically Echolink, but for
Linux terminal, which is pretty sweetl.
</p>

<p>
Other than that, I've been working on that 'JeeveSobs - Jagged Edges' album, and it has been coming along pretty
nicely. I have the song order in place, though during my last time on that Desktop, I think I might have nuked
the ALSA config by accident that I tweaked specifically for that Focusrite Solo Interface&#x2026; so it will probably
take a bit of digging to figure out how to get it to work again, most likely involving the 'aplay -l' command
to list devices again and see how to really make sure the devices are being listened to on the hardware level :/
</p>

<p>
I'm still torn on what specific isolated power supply I would like to my guitar / synth pedalboard, but I'm 
leaning towards this one from MXR in particular:
</p>

I archived all older blog posts back into the main "blog.html" page, and have removed all pages and references
to the older versions of the site, as I already have done a personal backup of the page itself.
</p>

<p>
If you ever wish to see the previous versions of the sites (though sometimes incomplete), you can visit the
Archive.org archived page here to view different scraped versions of this site from 2018 to 2020:

</ul>

<p>
I was debating making a "museum" section to showcase the older versions of the site. But honestly, it's better
to just remove as much bloat from the page as possible.
</p>

<p>
I think the 'git.musimatic.net' should be the main source page to shine for something like that, and I would
rather allow a given user to be able to easily download utilities in one-click (with the caveat that it
would only work in Linux anyway).
</p>

<p>
I'm still 50/50 on totally removing any bloated web app projects I have done in frameworks like AngularJS, React,
etc. I might section them off to a part of the site called "bloat.musimatic.net" to poke fun on how bloated
these same technologies are. One thing for certain is that I will be removing any "Bootstrap" CSS style link
references from any of the pages, so get used to the Geocities looking pages.
</p>

<p>
This is because:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I do not care if you are accessing this page on a mobile device.</li>
<li>I do not care if you want to zoom in or zoom out all the way and don't want the page to break.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here's what you can do:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Keep your browser's zoom level at 100%.</li>
<li>Stop using Windoze or MacOS on your personal computers.</li>
<li>Start using Linux or a BSD derivative, and surf the web as God intended with a used laptop or desktop to prevent e-waste.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is because I don't think the world should cave in to become mobile-friendly as I think non-rooted smart phones
are the absolute worst. Even if you use it for calling, you should switch to just a landline phone and have a
backup phone in your car for emergencies, that's it. Texting is pointless, and outdated since email does it better,
and more. Having a phone and any associated account allows companies to mine your personal data, spending habits,
location, etc. Granted, ISP's are probably doing the same thing anyway, you should be allowed to be "YOU" at all
times without any of these unnecessary worries ontop of modern living.
</p>

<p>
With that rant aside, I feel great about the years to come as I plan on living my life in a more independent fashion.
I am confident that with the right spending habits, and the right attitude on how to figure out next related steps 
that I will be able to raise a family in a positive manner.
</p>

<p>
As you can see, this blog part of the site has shown a lot of my efforts throughout its years of existence
as to the hopes I've had to really incorporate some cool projects out there. Some have been fulfilled, others
kind of didn't work out. On that front, I'm actually GLAD that they didn't.
</p>

<p>
Just in case you're wondering: No, I am not one of those awkward, ignorant boomers that think that "2021 will 
solve all of our problems" because it will only get worse. However, we can choose to live our lives our way, 
and today is an awesome day with God as we have lived to see it with the bare essentials to keep surviving.
</p>

<p>
That is the attitude you need to have to be happy these days!

I have coupled Gentoo with Emacs Window Manager (exwm), and honestly, it is fantastic!

<p>
The fonts, and unicode characters need to be adjusted as I'm not sure if you have to RICE it via '~/.Xresources' or via the Emacs config itself (but this

However, I even have 'vterm' support as well within Emacs, so that's pretty much spot on goal-wise to even try it out.
</p>

<p>
Since I'm utilizing Emacs Window Manager though, I can easily just use urxvt as the main terminal emulator as well, which is awesome.
</p>

<p>
I decided to take the plunge as I was getting sick of using AwesomeWM for some reason. More so, because I just wanted a full screen window manager, and less bloat 
present. I think I'll also switch my "Just Works" setup to be "FreeBSD" based instead of Devuan as well. Devuan's cool and all, but honestly, I think BSD sounds
even cooler since you can run both Linux AND BSD programs on BSD platforms through a compatibility layer.
</p>

<p>
I'm debating whether or not I should archive these posts from my blog or keep them as a running thing going forward to document the progress of how far I've come for
the past few years. I think the historical record would be neat. I do though like starting fresh each year though.
</p>

<p>
I plan on overhauling the site completely for the new year, and will archive the other sections of the site to remove any unnecessary bloated sections. This includes 
removing any "Bootstrap" dependent pages. I'll keep their memories alive with a "museum" section to showcase screenshots of how the site used to look, but its a bit
much to host 3+ versions of this site on the same webpage. This means that it will have a more basic look and feel, but will work better for anyone accessing the 
site via text-based web browser like 'Links', or 'w3m'. Also, I'm sick of Web 3.0 sites, and just want this page to look like an Geocities / Angelfire page as 
I've intended for quite some time this year.
</p>

<p>
I plan on having rotating color schemes that change each day as well, so it'll be fun to implement within a CronTab job. I will be hosting a "recipes" section from my 
recipe based .org files, and will include an awesome "links" section as well as I've harvested and archived quite a few awesome links to share. I realized that this
idea alone is the single greatest idea from older sites, as the web was supposed to connect individual pages where people spilled their heart out to the world.
</p>

<p>
Instead&#x2026; we have only a few major sites that control content for everyone else. I think the best thing we could all do is just make our own web pages again, and
link them together to keep the true spirit of the internet alive.
</p>

<p>
I did a lot of self-reflecting, especially with what I've done with my projects and this site, and I have got to say that I have had the most fun making useful utilities. 
I still aim on improving the 'w3mBookmarkSorter' with a related config file to match. Though it won't be available in a major Linux distribution's
package manager because the approval process takes forever, I think the right people will find it, and find it that much more useful.
I maybe could have done more cooler Twitter based bot projects tapping into API's, but those are nichey platform specific ideas that most people won't even find useful 
in a few years from now. I would love to possibly consider how to tap into Archive.org's API to archive content though, as I think that will be a major step in helping 
preserve the internet before it becomes another paid cable service variant.
</p>

<p>
I still plan on hacking my Wii-U this week a bit more with a few more homebrew apps to run Wii and Gamecube backups as well, so that's been fun. I also plan on utilizing 
my Raspberry Pi as a NAS device, and also to use it for RTLSDR to listen to ham radio frequencies. I'll need the related adapters, but this should keep my interest 
for a bit before considering a DMR radio + PiSpot in a few months.
</p>

<p>
I've been plunking away at that album that I've worked on for quite a few months, and the main guitar and vocal parts are done. I have to add drums, and maybe some synth 
sections. Other than that, just basic mixing, and it should be good to go. I don't plan on re-hosting my music on this site because of how large the bandwidth would be to
stream it, but I might host it on a separate VPS as I plan on hosting my own email, and re-host other web applications. I could still just store the files and people
could freely access them as intended.
</p>

<p>
I'm still glad I have the ability to create music though, as I recognize not everyone has the patience to learn an instrument. However, I am living proof that if I can
learn guitar, synth, vox, and drums by myself, then anyone can.
</p>

I had to create a throwaway email to post a GitHub issue, as I can't stand Microsoft anymore, let alone GitHub. Yet, like all similar services, you NEED to have an
account to raise an issue on some random GitHub project, so I had to figure out a way around this.
</p>

<p>
Luckily, there are some sites to easily make throwaway email accounts that get destroyed in 10 minutes or so, so here they are for a scenario like this:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://10minutemail.com/">https://10minutemail.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mailnesia.com/">https://mailnesia.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
There is another mail provider that provides you with basic free-tier email. Its doesn't last only 10 minutes, so this is a bit of an exception, but is better than
having to be forced to create a Gmail account which eventually forces you to use two-factor authentication via your private phone number, which they have no right
to obtain. This is the better alternative (for now):
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://protonmail.com/">https://protonmail.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I've assembled quite a list of sites to add to a 'Links' or 'WebRing' section to this site in the Geocities-style revision that will be released early next year.
</p>

<p>
Still debating if I should nuke the old variants of the site and just post screenshots of the design instead, as I wanted to use as little JS as possible going forward.

In my spare time, I've hacked my PS3 and Nintendo 3DS with custom firmware to load homebrew and similar applications.
</p>

<p>
The only thing left I would like to consider for the PS3 is how to figure out how to load .iso's via the NTFS backup external drive I have instead of having
to transfer the games to a FAT32-formatted flash drive in such a jenky fashion. I'm pretty sure there's a Linux utility to convert to .iso, so I think it won't
be too hard.
</p>

<p>
The result of the hacked 3DS has been awesome, since it gives you access to countless 3DS and DS game backups, etc. The only thing that sucks about the 'old' 3DS
or 'o3DS' series, is that it's not that great at emulating older systems via Retroarch. There are standalone emulators, but it just isn't perfect performance. 
However, you CAN inject game ROM's into Virtual Console to allow for perfect emulation for GB, GBC, GBA, NES, Genesis, and Game Gear for even the 'o3DS'. It just 
takes time to do this via the homebrew tools out there for this purpose from 'gbatemp'.
</p>

<p>
I've also settled on a Voip setup with an old school phone and am pretty happy that I went this route. Cell phones sucks,and texting sucks. There's literally no reason
why the same person who wants to send you a huge attachment of any kind via text can't literally open up a internet browser on even the weakest Android phone to send 
an email with a larger attachment size overhead. Plus, I prefer phone calls, and think anything that's like texting that ISN'T IRC or something is just a waste of time.
</p>

<p>
In terms of pet projects, I'm deadset on going the FreeBSD route, and have backed up my Devuan laptop accordingly. I'm a bit 50/50 on if I should keep babysitting
the Gentoo VM since its a love/hate relationship.
</p>

<p>
Though most Linux enthusiasts online will nail you for it, the "Just Works" philosophy sometimes is just better. At the end of the day, when I boot a computer, 
I don't want to have to worry about it breaking when I opened it just to use it. I realized that I'm still the type of guy that uses the minimal ISO install anyway, so 
I'm not like some people who depend on Ubuntu like they're on life support, and in that respect, I do build my computers the way I want, so its not like I haven't
made it my own.
</p>

<p>
However, I do love Gentoo for what it is. It's just a lot of work though, and it almost killed my SSD drive on the compiling alone since it went into read-only mode 
until I re-installed Devuan on it.
</p>

<p>
The only thing left I'm doing is debating what window manager to try going forward with the setup.
</p>

<p>
My current progression in the alternative OS cycle has been:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Lubuntu (LXDE) &gt; Debian (AwesomeWM + Openbox) &gt; Laptop: Devuan (AwesomeWM), Desktop: Devuan (AwesomeWM, Openbox)</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm considering any one of the following, but am tied between 'spectrwm', 'xmonad', or 'Qtile', so whatever has as an easy and minimal config will win since 
LuaScript (aka via AwesomeWM's config) sucks:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>i3 (<a href="https://i3wm.org/">https://i3wm.org/</a>)</li>
<li>bspwn (<a href="https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm">https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm</a>)</li>

<p>
I haven't felt well at all stomach-wise for the last few days, but today, I worked through it to get back into a routine.
</p>

<p>
I did a lot of self-reflection today, and realized that all the goals I set aside for work-related things really actually came to fruition this year.
</p>

<p>
I still haven't decked out my Emacs work configuration as far as it can just yet, and even then, that's probably maybe even 15% of the potential I could probably
experience with a finely tweaked Emacs setup. Even so, I was advised many times on IRC to really really really actually utilize Emacs Window Manager, so I might take
the dive. However, despite all of this, I am pretty proud what I know now compared to what I knew two years ago. It's mindblowing looking back, and really positive as 
well as humbling at the same time.
</p>

<p>
I re-organized all of the Org docs on my Devuan machine, and the result looks great. Even the ~/hub directory looks awesome too. I have been debating how to really
handle how to handle backups though for all of my stuff. Most likely I am going to utilize the Raspberry Pi 3 along with a 2 TB drive to jerryrig a poorman's LAN based 
NAS.
</p>

<p>
I got an SDXC card, and am also pretty excited to hack my old Nintendo 3DS soon too for homebrew and backups.
</p>

<p>
Might look into installing FreeBSD in a VM as I would like all my "Just Works" machines to be based in that. If its a Desktop machine, then I'll use Openbox as the window
manager. If its a laptop, then its using AwesomeWM&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
OR, I might look into seeing if there's a better lightweight alternative to AwesomeWM with an easier config file, as I DESPISE how it depends upon Lua script to configure
it. The syntax sucks. I would rather learn more ELisp to tweak Emacs than to try to figure out how Lua script works.
</p>

<p>
Even more so, I am at the point where I am debating removing the top widget altogether, and just displaying the current numbered "Desktop" within Tmux and do full screen 
for each Desktop window.
</p>

<p>
I basically want the most minimal X-Org server based window manager that would just boot into X. Ideally so I can just focus on terminal apps, with maybe a GUI browser
for stuff like banking websites and the like that depend upon sneaky JS scripts.
</p>

<p>
Some lightweight window managers I'm considering include:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>i3: <a href="https://i3wm.org/">https://i3wm.org/</a></li>
<li>bspwm: <a href="https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm">https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm</a></li>
<li>herbstluftwm: <a href="https://www.herbstluftwm.org/">https://www.herbstluftwm.org/</a></li>
<li>xmonad: <a href="https://xmonad.org/">https://xmonad.org/</a></li>
<li>spectrwm: <a href="https://github.com/conformal/spectrwm">https://github.com/conformal/spectrwm</a></li>
<li>jwm (Joe's Window Manager): <a href="http://joewing.net/projects/jwm/">http://joewing.net/projects/jwm/</a></li>
<li>qtile: <a href="http://www.qtile.org/">http://www.qtile.org/</a></li>
<li>ratpoison: <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/">https://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/</a></li>
<li>dwm: <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">https://dwm.suckless.org/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
All I know is that one day, I hope to rival K. Mandela's site (<a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/">https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/</a>) in either content or accessibility and ideas to really push 
terminal apps, Emacs, Vim, and Linux / FreeBSD forward!
</p>

<p>
Hoping I feel better soon though, but happy to keep my mind occupied!

I tried using my work Windoze laptop to install the PS3 firmware hack, but realized that the dumb laptop doesn't allow flash drives to be used while booted into
Windoze &#x2013;&gt; Into The Trash (Just kidding&#x2026; but I wish I could just use Linux all day, one can dream).
</p>

<p>
I instead utilized the 'md5sum' Linux terminal utility that's built in to verify the 'md5sum' hash of the download, and just utilized pcmanfm-qt to mount the drive.
</p>

<p>
I then used the following command to format the disk into "FAT32" (or 'vfat' on Linux):
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">sudo mkfs -t vfat /dev/sdb1
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I then listed all of the drives, including the USB flash drive, and verified that the command was successful:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">lsblk -f
</pre>
</div>

<p>
For reference purposes, I took the idea from this blog post, as I needed to figure this out quickly (because of limited patience, and since I just wanted a hacked
PS3 ASAP), so I must give credit where credit is due, as its a pretty good post:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-format-disk">https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-format-disk</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
After much attempts, I was able to get PS3 backup games running just fine with the "Multi-Man" utility, so it's been pretty awesome on that respect.
</p>

<p>
I plan on also hacking the 3DS later this week with this guide and a new SDXC card:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide/">https://3ds.hacks.guide/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Speaking of emulation, this page itself goes over what "No-Intro" rom sets were all about, and is worth a read as I'm aware of early ROM dumps of games that had
title screens (annoyingly) but its funny how the same project that aims to remove them included the very same people that put them into ROMs in the first place:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://no-intro.org/index.html">https://no-intro.org/index.html</a></li>

Enjoying surfing the net this fine Saturday morning, and I came across a few cool things in terms of old-school Geocities-esque pages.
</p>

<p>
This is a cool designed "Neocities" site that I absolutely adore the color and design of, never thought to put the navigation pane on the far right:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://jackomix.neocities.org/collection/">https://jackomix.neocities.org/collection/</a></li>

<p>
This is a search engine you can use to find older pages:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://wiby.me/">https://wiby.me/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Found a page that imparts the old-school tropes of all those 90's pages too. I forgot about the visitor counter, and background MIDI music, good idea ;)
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.business2community.com/social-buzz/make-fly-90s-website-geocities-tribute-01531323">https://www.business2community.com/social-buzz/make-fly-90s-website-geocities-tribute-01531323</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Found a cool tech reference page as well:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080730090550/http://oldfiles.org.uk/lightspeed/main.html">http://web.archive.org/web/20080730090550/http://oldfiles.org.uk/lightspeed/main.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
That reminds me&#x2026; I should probably start working on the site re-design to de-clutter this site again for the next re-design. Looking forward to it!
</p>

<p>
For the website re-design, I do plan on including a "Recipes" section in which I literally have a .org files for any of the food recipes I often refer to 
(which contain links to the actual people who made them for author credit purposes). Since .org files are pretty readable on its own, I don't think I'll need 
to convert to .pdfs either, since that would take a lot of space. However, it would convince a lot of people interested in learning how to cook Hungarian food 
to also utilize Emacs Org Mode, so its a Win-Win :)
</p>

<p>
Other than that, I was debating if I should hack the PS3 first, or figure out how to run Wii, Gamecube, and Wii-U backups on the hacked Wii-U I have.
</p>

<p>
Since I've been taking a mind vacation from doing anything major in terms of pet projects, I got a lot of great ideas for the "Sieges" side band, and plan 
on really exploring the potential of the Dungeon-Synth genre. There's probably going to be a lot of spoken word tropes with heavy reverb, and continuous motifs 
to match.
</p>

<p>
Really looking forward to getting my work-based Emacs config to get email working as that will help my daily workflow so much.
</p>

<p>
Keep Having Fun!

I created a separated config for Emacs for work, which is working out pretty nicely.
</p>

<p>
So far, I have Slack working in my work-based Emacs, which is really cool.
</p>

<p>
You can find out more about how to use 'Emacs-Slack' on their GitHub page:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/yuya373/emacs-slack/">https://github.com/yuya373/emacs-slack/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Slack sucks on its own to be honest. It is a dumb proprietary ElectronJS app that wants to be IRC so badly, but had to settle for being
a commonplace item in most workplaces. It's better than Google Suite tools I guess, but it's still based in good ol' spooky Chromium, so
you can't really trust it either. Especially since you don't control the logs &#x2013;&gt; your employer does. More so, with the trend of everything
being a layer of a Chromium browser, you start to realize Google really has a stranglehold on a lot of software out there now unfortunately.
</p>

<p>
Ideally, my entire work-life would be encapsulated within Emacs, so one could dream. I plan on taking stabs at this each week, ex: Got Slack
working this week, next week: work e-mail, the following week: ZenDesk's API via a Python 3 shell in Emacs, the following week: JIRA Mode in Slack.
The reason why you would want to do something like this is that you could manage your work tasks all in one place, with the multiple buffers 
available to you so that you can easily copy and paste, and move around between them without EVER having to use your mouse. It's beautiful ;).
</p>

<p>
Later, I might incorporate Emacs Window Manager into the mix to get an internet browser into the mix, but I think I'll be happy if I get
the basic workflow improved for my current job.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of Emacs, the Emacs Conference last week was pretty sick. Check out the pre-recorded videos here (I plan on checking out Rainer Konig's Org-Mode
talk in particular):
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://emacsconf.org/2020/schedule/">https://emacsconf.org/2020/schedule/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Other than that, I've been taking it easy. I got a used PS3 recently, and have been having a lot of fun. I plan on hacking it to
put some emulators and copied games on it, and other cool utilities. Also, I might beef up the Wii-U to play some Gamecube and Wii
ISO's as well, since I already hacked it a while ago with the "Haxchi" hack.
</p>

<p>
I have been doing art on Tuesdays, so I got further into the Loomis book I have. I studied and referenced bone anatomy, which is
coming along, though I have more fun sketching from random images or ideas to be completely honest.
</p>

<p>
I'm still debating how to best showcase my art from this year, and going forward. There's gotta be a lightweight "gallery" type app I 
can deploy for this reason alone since my current implementation is ok&#x2026; but not exactly what I would want.
</p>

<p>
Still thanking God for every day that I have the basic necessities, and am thankful to have had a good Thanksgiving week off. Really had a good
time as I made a ton of Hungarian food since family is so far away these days.
</p>

<p>
I'm still making topic ideas for YouTube vids, and will be recording a few screencasts with most likely 'ffmpeg'. The topics are probably
going to be on Linux, FreeBSD (and BSD derivatives), as well as audio production as I don't see too many people online that help with 
lower hardware, or just good sources of information on how to teach yourself some of the techniques present. I'm not saying I'm an expert,
but there are definitely things I have learned from doing things myself, and I feel that a lot of people could benefit from having easily accessible
Free-As-In-Freedom alternatives to bigger proprietary programs to empower them on a daily basis.
</p>

<p>
And yeah, maybe get the occasional sponsored hardware review to smack Linux or FreeBSD on wouldn't hurt either ;)
</p>

<p>
More so, if anyone like myself could learn and install Gentoo, I think at that point, ANYONE can (and should if they want to :D).
</p>

<p>
FreeBSD is pretty cool, and can be found here:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">https://www.freebsd.org/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
You basically can install whatever you want, especially with the minimal install, so its like Linux in a lot of ways but a bit better in terms of 
where the project is going. You can also run a lot of Linux software ON FreeBSD as well, so its a win-win for me in a lot of ways. I've been debating
making the plunge, but want to grow deeper into the Gentoo VM I had going, and swap to Slackware possibly before going to FreeBSD.
</p>

<p>
Keep Staying Positive, And Keep Your Life Balanced With Fun Side Projects!

I got my Gentoo VM up and running again, but its the classic scenario where you can't necessarily follow the Gentoo AMD64 handbook verbatim, as I had made
the mistake in making '/dev/sda2' or /boot as 'ext2' when you need to make it 'vfat' to handle the UEFI based boot process.

I had to adjust this by moving everything from /boot to /home, reformatting /boot to be with:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">mkfs.vfat /dev/sda2
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then, I re-installed Grub 2, and it worked thankfully after rebooting. I also enabled 'dhcpcd' this time around, so that networking is handled for me automatically.
</p>

<p>
That had to be like the 4th time I installed Gentoo (for reference, the third and fourth time were successfull). So, it's not like I didn't learn anything. I learned
so much in how Gentoo works with its "emerge" tool, as well as how to merge changes between files. It's a pretty exciting process in the weirdest way, but then again,
I'm really a Gentoo fan from the deepest part of my heart, and loathe Arch. The main reason is that Gentoo FROM THE GET-GO offers you the ability to choose to create
a Linux system without 'systemd' while you have to use a fork of Arch to even give you this option. This fact alone makes Gentoo that much more based.
</p>

<p>
However, this did not come without a few losses as I did unfortunately lose all my Gentoo installation notes that I made since the stupid SSD that went into read-only 
mode is exactly where I stored the notes like an idiot. Honestly, SSD's are such a meme, but unfortunately they are the future of drive storage.
</p>

<p>
As a result to kind of circumvent this issue from happening again, I've vowed to only make anything OTHER than the main Linux laptop to have one-way Git repos meaning 
they should only PULL changes, and not do any upstream changes.
</p>

<p>
I also did some re-organizing on my local Linux laptop to have a "hub" section to house all my repos and directories in one spot. I'm debating how I might use this kind
of idea to also host my Org-Mode notes on my site so I can interact with them between machines easily. I've been getting into really thinking and writing down different
tasks for at-home projects, or even just pet projects, and it really really really has kept me focused on what I can do now, vs. what I can do another time.
</p>

<p>
I did a lot of research into cable management as well since I still have the world's most giant Ethernet cable running throughout the house, so there are a few options
to fix this, as well as the multitude of audio cables for music stuff in the home office room too. I prefer it this way because most Wi-Fi drivers on Linux simply
run on non-Free software (Free As In Freedom), so you can't trust any of the non-free drivers as there's always the potential of it working against you. So, just use
an Cat 7 ethernet cable, and your problem is solved. Luckily there are a few ways to help manage cables like this, so I am happy to gauge what what options are the best
for this scenario.
</p>

<p>
I found this dude's site since he's a guy from Freenode IRC that is into "Software Defined" Radio, which is pretty neat. Love the site's easy layout, and might steal
some good design layouts, and I like how easy it is, especially with the left and right sides of the page:
</p>

</ul>

<p>
Speaking of software defined radio, it's not that expensive to get into it, and you don't even need a Ham Radio license to listen in since its all about RECEIVING signals
and not transmitting (Yes, there are transmitting-capable SDR's too, but they're boomer-tier priced, and its better to just use the cheaper option listen in anyway for 
this kind of thing).
</p>

<p>
Here's the more budget friendly option to listen to Ham Radio bands since you can stick this near a window sill, and you're good to as you just need to plug it into your 
computer's USB port and utilize it with related free radio software:
</p>

<p>
On a total separate note, I've been debating getting a used Sony PS3, since the games are super cheap, and I would love to play some of the "Warriors" series ports again,
as the Sony ports were always superior. More and more, I've become okay with game consoles being just better than PC's, as the modern Windoze PC spies on you anyway, and
I prefer just single player offline games not connected to the Internet from time to time.
</p>

<p>
The deals on eBay for old used PS3 games are pretty enticing, I must say.

<p>
I might look into stealing more cool ideas from Emacs configs from the likes of "Uncle Dave" from YouTube, as well as Sacha Chua, both of which have deep knowledge of 
Emacs inside and out. Here are their configs for reference:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/daedreth/UncleDavesEmacs">https://github.com/daedreth/UncleDavesEmacs</a></li>

</ul>

<p>
Looking forward to maybe getting EXWM aka Emacs Window Manager up and running as well as X-Org running on that Gentoo install, as I wanted to "live" within that Gentoo VM 
for 6 months before transferring the entire setup from a virtual machine to bare metal hardware. I just don't want to take the jump necessarily yet because I don't want
to lose any data if I screw up along the way, and also, since I'm trying to ween into being that kind of elevated super type of Linux user.
</p>

<p>
Planning to use this Gentoo guide as a reference for the X-Org setup, as I'm kind of a noob that's a bit too used to making a login manager like 'lightdm' do this for me
automatically, but I'm looking forward to figuring out how to make X-Org work with 'startx' and then figure out how to tweak it to my needs:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xorg/Guide">https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xorg/Guide</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Ideally, I would want to boot into X, which would then boot into Emacs via Emacs Window Manager so that everything contained within each buffer could interact with Emacs
seemlessly.
</p>

<p>
Some really cool YouTube videos that show how awesome this is include the following:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MquoGuU8sHM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MquoGuU8sHM</a></li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9808810">

I finally uploaded my 'w3mBookmarkSorter' project to my Git repository, which can be found here:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://git.musimatic.net/w3mBookmarkSorter">https://git.musimatic.net/w3mBookmarkSorter</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
You can 'git clone' the repo with the following command so you can use the utility locally on your Linux machine:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">git clone https://git.musimatic.net/w3mBookmarkSorter
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Further installation instructions can be found in the "README.md" file included in the project.
</p>

<p>
It's a pretty cool little simple utility that sorts the bookmarks from A to Z for 'w3m' as the functionality just doesn't exist yet. Is it slightly 
bloated because its based on Python 3? MAYBE, but some programming languages like Python 3 just have better libraries for this kind of idea straight 
from the box, so its worthwhile for someone who needs this done quickly.
</p>

<p>
I DID note that there is an HTML parser from 'w3.org' themselves, which helps maintain the internet standards for the 'www' protocol which seems 
kind of neat, and light-weight:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/Tools/HTML-XML-utils/README">https://www.w3.org/Tools/HTML-XML-utils/README</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
We'll see if its worth a re-write later using this utility instead. However, I'm too quick to just make a Python 3 based webscraper due to old habits,
so honestly, I can't blame myself for it at this point.
</p>

<p>
I tried playing around with the '/etc/cgitrc' config for the Cgit instance of my Git repository to include the following config settings, which I'll have
to see if they actually worked for the Git repository itself. The goal was to enable downloads, and to have syntax highlighting to easily read any
code that is present:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash"><span style="color: #2aa1ae; background-color: #292e34;"># </span><span style="color: #2aa1ae; background-color: #292e34;">Enable ASCII art commit history graph on the log pages</span>
enable-commit-graph=1

<span style="color: #2aa1ae; background-color: #292e34;"># </span><span style="color: #2aa1ae; background-color: #292e34;">Allow download of atr.gz, tar.bz2 and zip-files</span>
<span style="color: #7590db;">snapshots</span>=tar.gz tar.bz2 zip

<span style="color: #2aa1ae; background-color: #292e34;"># </span><span style="color: #2aa1ae; background-color: #292e34;">Highlight source code with python pygments-based highlighter</span>

<span style="color: #2aa1ae; background-color: #292e34;"># </span><span style="color: #2aa1ae; background-color: #292e34;">Format markdown, restructuredtext, manpages, text files, and html files</span>
<span style="color: #2aa1ae; background-color: #292e34;"># </span><span style="color: #2aa1ae; background-color: #292e34;">through the right converters</span>
about-filter=/usr/lib/cgit/filters/about-formatting.sh
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Ideally, I'm literally shooting for copying the same kind of ideas from the Cgit creators' own repository for 'cgit', since they have easy accessible "Download" links, and
"Clone" instructions:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/">https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Anyway, got some major wins today on those two points alone. There's definitely  something that can be learned from my 'w3mBookmarkSorter' project: Keep your project 
scope small, keep it useable, and easy to use.
</p>

<p>
Here's To Making Awesome Utilities For People To Use To Improve Their Workflow!

<h2 id="org36673ad">November 19, 2020</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org36673ad">
<p>
I debated how to properly deploy the 'w3mBookmarkSorter' project, and it turns out that it'll be a hard uphill battle on how to package it for the Debian
release. This is important because the major 'w3m' fork, even on GitHub, is for Debian itself. The project itself is based in C, while my plugin uses
Python 3 with the BeautifulSoup4 library.
</p>

<p>
That being noted, I'm most likely going to just create an alt account on GitHub to host stuff as well, but also mirror it on my own Git page as well.
</p>

<p>
I've been assembling ideas in Org-Mode docs for what I want to learn, and this has helped me a TON for focusing on what I want to learn for work based
skills, and especially in building my own current Linux skills.
</p>

<p>
I am really understanding that to better learn anything new, its better to consult the man page or the Arch Wiki, which is hilarious for someone like myself
that refuses to run anything Arch based in the first place. However, the Arch Wiki is an amazing resource, so I think its something I'm going to learn towards.
Too often I quickly try to search for something on DuckDuckGo when I could have easily just tried to find it myself.
</p>

<p>
For example, I'm trying to learn LaTeX so I can re-create my own resume in LaTeX because I think modern WYSIWYG editors are trash, and I want a resume that's
not dependent on Microsoft products. I had to install a package called "texlive", which is apparently a distribution of LaTeX. That being noted, I tried to do
the most obvious thing, and tried to just do:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">man texlive
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This yielded nothing for me.
</p>

<p>
Then, I looked into more resources on how to take advantage of man pages (manual pages), and figure out what manuals actually exist on your system. I found out
that the 'apropos' utility is your friend in this scenario.
</p>

<p>
So, to use the previous example, we can pipe that into 'less' so that you can have nice readable output, and figure out what man page to actually use:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">apropos tex | less
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Using this, I was able to see many, many, MANY LaTeX related resources that already existed on my system.
</p>

<p>
And then&#x2026; I figured out I could just look at the 'man' page for 'latex'&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
But hey, I learned something in the process, and in doing so, I answered my own question in terms of what specific 'man' page I can refer to.
</p>

<p>
Found a cool site totally by accident as I was looking for games to improve my Vim skills:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://vimm.net/?p=emulate">https://vimm.net/?p=emulate</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
It's websites like this that make me want to copy their look, style, and feel.
The functionality of that site itself is inviting, and just overall easy to manage.
</p>

<p>
Definitely will be taking notes to improve the "Geocities"-esque overhaul later this year.
</p>

<p>
Here are some cool 'Vim' based games to check out too that I found:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/tjdevries/train.nvim">https://github.com/tjdevries/train.nvim</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/vim-be-good">https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/vim-be-good</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I found out about 'Vim' games through this crazy, but informative talk on how to play Vim like
an instrument, and YES, this guy actually uses sounds for his Vim macros, which is nuts, cool,
and awesome at the same time:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJqnWXDJZr0&amp;t=1691s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJqnWXDJZr0&amp;t=1691s</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I've learned a lot today in terms of Linux shell commands, especially how to utilize the 'man' command
to reference manuals or 'man' pages.
</p>

<p>
I've also made a schedule of video topics to possibly do screencasts for. I think I'll do YouTube videos
like 'gotbletu' without showing a webcam, as I would rather the content to be the primary feature
being presented. I also plan to backup these same vids to Internet Archive and to PeerTube just in case
as well given the state of YouTube these days.
</p>

<p>
However, I only want to do informative, helpful, and just fun screencast videos on Linux, BSD platforms,
music creation, and neat pet projects to inspire others. Maybe even stuff on Ham Radio, mesh networks,
etc., would be awesome too.
</p>

<p>
I also want to deploy my latest band's album on my own site too to not depend on any platform like Bandcamp.
That has been a lot of fun to work on, and I'm up to maybe around 4 decent songs at the moment with a 3 or
4 other ones in very early stages. It's a lot of acoustic and vocals so far, which is pretty new to me as
I used to never like acoustic until recently.
</p>

<p>
Lots and lots of goals, and only so much time.
</p>

<p>
Good thing there's Org-Mode to organize it all ;)

I am debating to mail this to the 'w3m' team as a patch plugin for 'w3m' via email as I think anyone who uses 'w3m' would absolutely LOVE this functionality,
as w3m doesn't sort bookmarks at all by default.

I tried tweaking my Gentoo VM to be able to add a different "profile" to allow it to download the [20] desktop specific option.
The reason for doing this is so that I can add the necessary "USE" variable flags to be able to install xorg-server, so that I can
install Emacs Window Manager. During this entire process, the SSD drive gave in, and went into read-only mode, which freaked me out 
to say the least, because I thought the drive died on me. I vowed to never buy into the SSD meme again, but I did re-set the power 
and SATA cable, and that seemed to fix the issue, even though I have to re-install Devuan on that particular drive, and re-do the 
entire Gentoo install. Apparently that dumb 'read-only' issue is typical for SSD's unfortunately, so it's something you just have to
live with. Just so that SSD drive doesn't go into read-only mode again, I actually might just stick with trying FreeBSD in a VM 
instead and to go with FreeBSD going forward, and never to try Gentoo again.
</p>

<p>
I think what I learned out of that experience is that distros like Gentoo or Slackware might put too much stress on harddrives, so
even though its cool to learn the underlying components and to "tweak them" accordingly, someone like myself would be better off
using something that's bleeding edge, but works better straight from the box.
</p>

<p>
Installing Gentoo is kind of like the process of maintaining Arch for me, where it literally takes hours trying to figure out what's broken
or how it even works in the first place. I realized as I've gotten older that I just care about the pet projects, and as long as the 
underyling OS isn't spying on me and is working as intended, my level of caring stops there. I want to customize, but don't want to 
spend an entire weekend trying to wait to get something to work.
</p>

<p>
The biggest thing I've learned is that I have got to backup my data once a month to my spare external HDD just in case.
</p>

<p>
On a more positive note, I've been assembling more and more Org docs with todo lists, and am planning to possibly make a Wiki out of them
and to place them onto my site.
</p>

<p>
I re-learned a lot of Vim through 'vimtutor', and am still amazed on how good Vim is comparatively.
</p>

<p>
I've come to the realization that I'll keep Emacs for Org mode TODO lists, but am more interested in pursuing more plugin options with
Neovim instead.
</p>

<p>
I worked on the w3mBookmarkSorter project a bit, and thought of how to more effectively sort the links present, and will apply the same
idea to the actual project sometime this week.
</p>

<p>
I also got my ElectronJS project for work to actually compile again, so I plan on learning either more NodeJS on the side, or go through
a bunch for ElectronJS videos to figure out how to effectively add a feature to use HTTP requests to pull logs for one of the work apps
I help support within the ElectronJS app itself.
</p>

<p>
I am in the process of learning how to use "Jami" on Linux, and will do a test run on Windoze 10 with Firefox so that family members who
depend on proprietary operating systems could also use it, as I'm trying to find the best VOIP or messaging solution that's secure, and
cross-platform. This is more so because I hate having to spend minutes upon minutes for a feature phone when I have unlimited internet
that can do the same exact features. Will do more Windoze related testing later this week. On Linux, "Jami" is run by using "gnome-ring", 
since that was the name of the project before the name change to "Jami" a few years ago.
</p>

'Jami' can be found here:

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org02e3e70">
<p>
I worked on the 'w3mBookmarkSorter' project, and made a lot of headway by just re-thinking and reducing
the amount of Python 3 code present.
</p>

<p>
I think I'm pretty close to what I want, and will most likely release utilities like this on a public
Git instance as I think 'w3m' as a whole could benefit from something like this.
</p>

<p>
Though I like Emacs a lot, I realized its much more fun and simpler to just use terminal apps instead.
I'm done more fighting with Emacs to even try to get it to run shells, as it just doesn't do proper, 
fully-feature shells out of the box. I don't want to have to patch Emacs just to get a shell working on it. 
</p>

<p>
Sure, there's "eshell", "shell", etc, but the only decent one, "VTerm", seemed usable only if you re-compile 
Emacs from source, which is a pain if you want to distribute it amongst multiple machines like I do.
</p>

<p>
I don't mind seeking to learn how to compile programs from source on distros like Gentoo, but for my current
workflow, I just want it to be up and running ASAP. Especially if I'm primarily using Emacs as a text editor,
and not an all-in-one utility. Its this lack of shell support straight from the box that makes me want to 
instead configure Neovim instead, as I still love 'tmux' so much.
</p>

<p>
I will still configure Emacs to help my Org-Mode workflow for everyday ticket work though, and still look 
forward to using it for that reason. However, even more on this, I even don't want to use Evil-Mode (Vim 
keybindings) on Emacs anymore either because I think the keybindings overall just fight you from step 1 
when you try to do this. I think the best way to use Emacs is just to use it as intended, and just use
packages to make it that much easier to use.
</p>

<p>
Either way, Vim and Emacs still beats using a mouse for text editing. ;)
</p>

<p>
I've worked more on the re-design of the site, and it's looking more and more what I want it to be in terms
of it being simple to look at, and more Geocities based. You can check it out here:

</ul>

<p>
I've been watching movies to chill out this week mostly, and haven't done too much art honestly.
</p>

<p>
Also, I saw that Parabola is moving to BSD in a few years because of dependency on "Rust", "systemd", and
even "Pulseaudio" being forced on the Linux kernel level. Definitely will start checking out FreeBSD in that
case within a VM, and using that as the daily driver instead of Devuan honestly. The cool thing about the BSD's
is that you can totally run any Linux program you want with a compatibility layer, so I could still use AwesomeWM,
Openbox, etc, without a single problem. Related Parabola announcement can be found here:

I deployed my 'cgit' instance here:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>git.musimatic.net</li>
</ul>

<p>
I basically replaced the existing 'GitWeb' instance with 'cgit', which is really nice. All it needs is
a dark theme, and I think it should be fine.
</p>

<p>
I tweaked my Emacs config a bit, and its looking pretty good so far. I'm pretty impressed with just the
simply default zoom based Hydra command for example since I really like the idea behind it to just keep
repeating the same macro until another key is pressed. 
</p>

<p>
Helm is pretty cool, but the colors with the somewhat default Emacs theme looks a bit jenky, so I might have
to tweak it a bit. Also the "Ranger" implementation from MELPA kind of sucks, and makes me want to instead 
utilize a shell within Emacs for all my 'tmux' based programs to be pretty honest.
</p>

<p>
I kind of hate 'dired' mode as its not really inviting, intuitive, or helpful in terms of what features it 
can provide. I think Ranger is far superior to this, so I think the best thing I could do is to somehow run
'tmux' in a shell and go from there.
</p>

<p>
I played around with the Geocities re-design of the site, and I'll admit, its pretty fun going back to basics
in terms of CSS styling. Bootstrap, although nice looking for some startup websites, is a bit too much, and 
in itself kind of generic if you think about it.
</p>

<p>
I think my best approach would be to just make the new Geocities site mobile friendly first (or I guess, just
not care about mobile) and then size it up from there.
</p>

<p>
I tried to install Emacs Window Manager on Gentoo, but didn't realize that my networking device had reverted
from 'eth0' to some randomized interface name, which is a bit annoying. I had to modify the Grub init file to
allow the ethernet cable network adapter to just be named as 'eth0' to resolve the connection issues. With
that in mind, I'll have to try EXWM another day.
</p>

<p>
I've been debating what IRC server to install. I'll have to probably use 'Unrealirc' for the IRC server itself,
or 'ngIRCd':

<li><a href="https://ngircd.barton.de/">https://ngircd.barton.de/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
In terms of the front-end IRC webpage, I think I'll probably choose one of the following:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://convos.chat/">https://convos.chat/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://kiwiirc.com/">https://kiwiirc.com/</a></li>

I'm in the process of deploying 'cgit' to git.musimatic.net via nginx.
</p>

<p>
The one important link command to create a symlink in this kind of scenario, let's
say "default" would be:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
</pre>
</div>

<p>
It's not working yet, but I do understand the concept of what I'm doing in terms of
making sure nginx understands to listen on Port 80, and then run 'fcgiwrap' to actually
deploy the website showing the git repository. I did install it from source by using
the related tarball.
</p>

<p>
I know the end result will look awesome, so it's worth the effort.
</p>

<p>
I tried working on the one 'w3mBookmarkSorter' project, but I couldn't get my head around
how to really fix the underlying issues present. The output doesn't really look like the
desired format. I'm wondering at this point if instead I could just treat blocks of HTML
tags within the bookmark html file in the BeautifulSoup4 parser. I do use 'w3m' quite a bit
so it would be a cool utility to have, and I might even fork 'w3m' to add it as an additional
script.
</p>

<p>
I might work more on the ElectronJS app for work to feel a bit more productive. I ran into 
an issue earlier this week where I got some obscure JS compilation error, but I blame Windows 
honestly since it was a Microsoft based error. It MIGHT be because of the use of 'puppeteer-in-electron'
dependency though as a lot of the related forum posts on the related error are for obscure PATH variable
references.
</p>

<p>
I try to get Emacs Window Manager working on that Gentoo VM this weekend. Will also keep at it in terms
of drawing, as I'm getting more and more comfortable with Andrew Loomis style wireframes, though they're
pretty crude and hard to do at this point for me.

<p>
We'll see.

I am looking into how to deploy "cgit" instead of my current GitWeb instance,
as I never seem to use it anyway, and kind of think it sucks.
</p>

<p>
There's something a bit uninviting for it, especially if you just have it present
to show dotfiles or something else in a public repo.
</p>

<p>
Here's the site for 'cgit':
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about/">https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I did find a blog post on the same topic that I might rip from if I can't figure
out to get it working on 'nginx' myself though. I do still plan on building it
from source as I don't see a Debian based port unfortunately:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://eliteinformatiker.de/2020/02/16/installing-cgit-nginx-on-debian">https://eliteinformatiker.de/2020/02/16/installing-cgit-nginx-on-debian</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Here's a related example article from 'nginx' on deploying a FastCGI to host
something like 'cgit':
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/fastcgiexample/">https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/fastcgiexample/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
An even neater thing to note is the 'cgit' creator's own website:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.zx2c4.com/">https://www.zx2c4.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I absolutely love how he just displays his projects in a never ending page,
that basically links to just cgit repos for each project. That is PERFECT.
I plan on trying to do the same thing once I get my 'cgit' instance working.
</p>

<p>
His own 'cgit' instance is awesome too, and I love the idea of mirrors at the
bottom as well:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/">https://git.zx2c4.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
One minor 'wget' command I learned today to archive entire sites is the following
command:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">wget -r -np -nH -R index.html 
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The parameters that it uses include (from the 'wget' man page):
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>-r: recursive: Retrieve recursively</li>
<li>-np: no parent: Do not ever ascend to the parent directory when retrieving recursively</li>
<li>-nH: no host directories: disable generation of host-prefixed directories</li>
<li>-R: reject list: Specify comma-separated lists of file name suffixes or patterns to accept or reject</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can use this to archive your own site from a Linux bash terminal.
</p>

<p>
I've been debating what mail program to deploy for my own email next year, as I want to move away
from the paid service I've been using. It's okay, but I want the challenge of doing it myself.
</p>

<p>
Since I already pay for a separate VPS for this site, and paid for a year of service for the other
paid email provider, I think it makes more sense to just then beef up this VPS instead.
</p>

<p>
On that note, I might even jump to a different VPS provider like Vultur or something.
</p>

<p>
These are the email clients I've been debating to deploy:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://mailcow.email/">https://mailcow.email/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dovecot.org/">https://www.dovecot.org/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.postfix.org/">http://www.postfix.org/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.opensmtpd.org/">https://www.opensmtpd.org/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The only downside to hosting your own email is that you have to nuke spam emails from orbit with
the right tools.
</p>

<p>
Some of the best tools I've seen include the following:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.rspamd.com/">https://www.rspamd.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://spamassassin.apache.org/">https://spamassassin.apache.org/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Have fun archiving sites, and deploying your own email.

I looked into FreeBSD, and wow, I am impressed. It pretty much can run most
Linux software in its own compatibility layer. This includes window managers,
and other key things I use on a daily basis.
</p>

<p>
Here's some great vids on the topic of using FreeBSD as a Desktop-centered
OS:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4WXHdB_-98">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4WXHdB_-98</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=revOJcX2rLs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=revOJcX2rLs</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I think I might even swap out my go-to Devuan setup for just a FreeBSD setup
to run Linux based VM's though I'll have to try out FreeBSD in a VM first.
Also, I'll probably get into this if I get bored of my Gentoo install as well.
</p>

<p>
I saw this website randomly, and I really like how he has his web apps setup,
so I might steal this kind of design for the "Apps" section of all my web
app projects for the re-design of this site:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://tecosaur.com/">https://tecosaur.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I found out about that previous site because that same person is the one that
re-designed the Org Mode website, which looks awesome by the way, and WAY better
than the previous site:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://orgmode.org/index.html">https://orgmode.org/index.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Found out about "Binder mode", and this looks awesome as well. Definitely would
try this in terms of binding together several free-flowing idea type notes.
Would be great in the context of songwriting lyrics, etc.:

<p>
I bought a used NUX Solid Studio pedal the other day, so I'm looking forward 
to using it on the album I've been working on.
</p>

<p>
I've been debating a keyboard amp or guitar amp setup, and I think this would
be a great alternative for the time being, as I primarily just record music
and play music at home anyway. I can finally use the amp-in-a-box type
pedal I've had laying around, and put it right in front of the NUX Solid Studio,
and then use an existing multi-fx pedal I have for the effects section.
</p>

<p>
I also plan on slowly building a pedalboard from some of my existing pedals, but
also a separate one dedicated to loops and effects.
</p>

<p>
I cheaped out a while ago, and got two Ikea Hejne shelves for like around $10, 
and voilah, two full size pedalboards. Just have to get some more velcro tape 
and I'm set. It's hilarious how much money you can save on things like this,
as the metal variants are about $60 to $100 more, especially if we're talking
about the Pedaltrain Pro type pedalboards.
</p>

<p>
I learned about this trick from this vid, so I would check it out if you're 
interested in creating a pedalboard on the cheap:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvGFGc9e-oA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvGFGc9e-oA</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
More and more, I've decided that instead of potentially building or buying
a cheapo or used guitar, I'll just mess around with my existing Tele clone
guitar. I will most likely have to buy a soldering iron later on, but I think
this would be my entry point into electronics and instrument building to
be honest. I will most likely swap out the neck pickup, and the underlying
electronics as I'm interested in the GFS Kwikplug system to easily swap
out pickups on the fly.
</p>

<p>
I think the idea of getting more pedals is because I've been watching more
and more guitar pedal demo videos just to relax. This channel in particular
is pretty awesome on this topic:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgDlf_Pp6os">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgDlf_Pp6os</a></li>

</ul>

<p>
Some of these guitar pedal designs are so beautiful and inspiring. I honestly
wish I could make some to demo out and have some fun with, and somehow make
them interact with the internet in weird ways.
</p>

<p>
I've been also on the hunt for more VSTs or plugins to use in Reaper. I found
this one to be a pretty cool one, as it emulates the Super Nintendo's 
Yamaha SPC700 sound chip. I'll see if it'll play nicely in Carla on Linux
based Reaper. Worth a shot though:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://picopicose.com/software.html">http://picopicose.com/software.html</a></li>

<p>
A really good reference on the SPC700 soundchip, as well as related Super
Nintendo music is this site. Definitely worth checking out for the simple
site design alone:

I began working on the "Yahoo Finance Stock Ticker App" project.
</p>

<p>
I'm planning on assigning a "Scrapy" based agent to each of the pages, and
to consistently return the same data feed.
</p>

<p>
Here is a link to the related "Scrapy" Python 3 module:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://scrapy.org/">https://scrapy.org/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm using this instead of BeautifulSoup 4 as I'd like multiple agents to send
asynchronous requests instead of just one at a time.
</p>

<p>
I'd like maybe deploy this with some kind of lightweight backend program like
'Flask' in combination with React to make it sort of a hybrid between 
Python 3 and JS.
</p>

<p>
We'll see how it turns out :)
</p>

<p>
I've learned how to use the 'venv' Python 3 command to store a virtual environment
for this project as well, as I usually have had the bad habit to just pull in
dependencies for cron job projects.
</p>

<p>
With this approach, you can easily deploy the same project to multiple platforms 
without having to run a million pip3 commands to make sure that dependencies are 
pulled in, since 'requirements.txt' takes care of that for you.
</p>

<p>
To get started, make sure you first 'cd' into your project:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python3">cd /path/to/your/project
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Here's the command to get started using 'venv' to create a virtual environment
for your Python 3 project by utilizing the 'python3 -m' parameter so that we can
focus on utilizing the script from one specific module, which is 'venv', aka the 
first instance of 'venv' in the following command. NOTE: The second 'venv' parameter 
can be named whatever you want, though usually, its a convention to name any 
Python 3 virtual environments as'venv':
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python3">python3 -m venv venv
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Here's the major 'venv' command to activate a virtual environment once you have entered
your project directory:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python3">source venv/bin/activate
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Once you activate your virtual environment ("venv"), then use 'pip3 install' and install
any required packages. In my case, I did 'pip3 install scrapy' for example so that
I can work with that module for this project.
</p>

<p>
Here's the related command to store all the 'pip3' packages into 'requirements.txt':
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python3">pip3 freeze &gt; requirements.txt
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The most important thing is to NOT add your 'venv' to your actual .git directory if 
you plan on using 'git' as your version source control method, as you only need
'requirements.txt', and the user just needs the 'requirements.txt' file to build
the 'venv' themselves.
</p>

<p>
Here's the command to exit the 'venv' virtual environment:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python3">deactivate
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Here's another scenario:
Let's say that you wanted to utilize the 'pip3' modules that are native and already 
present on the current machine but ADD to those packages for a given project.
</p>

<p>
You can instead use the following command, which allows you to add more 'pip3' 
dependencies for that project by initially piggybacking off the already existing 
global dependencies and allows you to add in new 'pip3' dependencies JUST for that 
given project:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python3">python3 -m venv venv --system-site-packages
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you wanted to list the local dependencies in that above scenario, you can utilize
the following command:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python3">pip3 list --local
</pre>
</div>

<p>
It's interesting that I've gone through the entire gambit of a lot of Linux based installs,
both OS-level, and just installing Linux programs (by compiling from source, etc), and 
something like Python 3's 'venv' virtual environment just makes sense to me. I never
used it before because I thought it was useless, but after having to revive my old
Python 3 project websites for probably the third time after a site re-design, I 
realized that its the best way going forward to deploy Python 3 apps.
</p>

<p>
On a separate note, I found a pretty cool "public access" UNIX system that 
allows you to access remote shells, and shared logins. Very cool concept,
might play with this sometime this week:

I've been doing more and more art in Grafx2.
</p>

<p>
It's one of those positive things to do despite any frustrations in life. 
</p>

<p>
Any time doing art is time well spent. I don't care what anyone says on that 
front, since if they say its a waste of time, then they probably don't have 
any useful talent either.
</p>

<p>
What I've always like about art is that I can easily see the progression,
as well as the risks I took. I definitely hit a block mid-year this year 
where I didn't really do much art or music. I did some more self-analysis 
recently, and realized that I still had fun with it, even if the quality of 
said art was getting good or bad.
</p>

<p>
I would love to do some demo scene type art, but realize that I still need
to keep building the fundamentals. I've been playing around with the ideas
of proportions from the Loomis book. However, his eye for perspective is
almost too freakishly good to the point where you either quit, or at least
try to imitate it.
</p>

<p>
Perspective is definitely a weakness of mine, even with the reference 
"Perspective Made Easy" book I readily have available to me.
</p>

<p>
I can think YEARS back in time when I still thought it was such a weird
concept anyway. It sort of almost ruins the creation process a bit, but
as you get older, you realize that it's really important in order to scale
things up appropriately.
</p>

<p>
I've been writing more songs for another album for a band I'm going to call
JeeveSobs, which is more or less just another midwest emo band.
</p>

<p>
However, this time, I don't want to suffer from poor audio mixing quality, 
and I really really REALLY want to make sure it sounds good this time around. 
Though you can tell I became more aware of how a mix should be over the years 
through my music, I really never gave the thought to just hand that sort of thing
to someone else instead.
</p>

<p>
I've only trusted maybe a handful of people who even know the vibe of the kind
of music I make, but even then, its still hard to find anyone who won't
charge a lot just to mix a few songs, so we'll see if I actually get the 
album mixed by anyone in particular.
</p>

<p>
I don't think I have a gift for mixing, and I think that's the best thing you
CAN admit in order to improve. I'll have to think of the best options around
this but I'm glad to say this as I critique my own work alot.
</p>

<p>
I even sat back and thought about this website, and though I am happy with the
progress, I could easily just turn it into a demo scene art page or something
and even be happier.
</p>

<p>
I have learned a lot in terms of what "scope creep" is, and to just keep your
ideas to a bare minimum. 
</p>

<p>
I'm at a point of my life where if I don't see progress on something within
like 2 weeks or so, I easily lose interest. I just don't want another repeat
of that "ExpressOrLocalApp" project where I spent several months on a project
to ultimately not really see the effort being actually used. Let's all take a
laugh at how I made an MTA data app that is basically now useless. It still
is kinda funny.
</p>

<p>
But yeah, in all seriousness, that's why I stick to small web apps these days.
</p>

<p>
Keep on working at it!

Today was a great day.
</p>

<p>
I finally did it.
</p>

<p>
I finally installed Gentoo in a VM.
</p>

<p>
It took three separate attempts over two weekend sessions but I got it booted 
thankfully. I plan on figuring out how to maybe get Emacs Window Manager present in that 
particular VM as well, so that's gonna be a cool project indeed. Otherwise, my 
related installation guide is now pretty complete, so I could easily do it again
in less than an hour if I needed to.
</p>

<p>
I also got my old-as-heck ExpressOrLocalApp project back up and running, which is 
semi-hilarious because I doubt anyone actualy still uses the 7 Train in NYC anymore.
But hey, its updated every minute for anyone who wants this data. I had to re-adjust
a few things as the MTA changed their data feed to be more API key specific, so it
was a bit of a pain of trying to read their recent post in the related MTA Data 
Google Group post on the API Key change. 
</p>

<p>
However, I had enough ingenuity to figure out how to change the "headers" section 
for the requests.get() function call, and baby, we are LIVE again! :D
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://musimatic.net/pythonprojectwebsites/ExpressOrLocalApp/output.html">https://musimatic.net/pythonprojectwebsites/ExpressOrLocalApp/output.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I've been trying to wrap my head around placing my Emacs configuration file into
an Org Mode document since I found out about "Hydra" and "Helm" within Emacs,
and just felt the need to figure out how to finally configure Emacs since I've
been using it for quite some time now.
</p>

<p>
Some really good references on this topic include these links:

</ul>

<p>
Also, in this same burst of research, I found another guy just like myself who literally
blogs on his site using Emacs Org Mode in one giant org doc:
</p>

<p>
I also found this really cool Linux reference link page from a guy on IRC, which is neat
and very organized:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.msiism.org/links.html">https://www.msiism.org/links.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Also, through that same guy's site, I found other really really useful Linux reference links 
for Linux based audio programs as well:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://linux-sound.org/">http://linux-sound.org/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://linuxsynths.com/">http://linuxsynths.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I found this really useful comprehensive list site on Window Managers as well:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.gilesorr.com/wm/table.html">https://www.gilesorr.com/wm/table.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
This part of his page lists window managers based on the programming languge they're based in, 
which is super helpful in deciding what window manager to use, since if you can better understand
the config file, you can easily modify yourself:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.gilesorr.com/wm/languages.html">https://www.gilesorr.com/wm/languages.html</a></li>

This same guy's list of helpful Linux utilities is awesome too:

<li><a href="https://www.gilesorr.com/wm/helpers.html">https://www.gilesorr.com/wm/helpers.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
On a total side note, I found these pretty hilarious Geocities looking sites,
which I might copy in terms of style when I re-design the site later this year:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.lingscars.com/">https://www.lingscars.com/</a></li>

<p>
Keep having fun :)

This week has been a bit long in many ways, so I was looking for more ways
to get back into doing digital art this weekend to just relax.
</p>

<p>
I still have that Loomis art book laying around so I might read that.
</p>

<p>
I found these two goldmines for art learning, both of which have a ton of
related links:

I didn't even know people replace drawing tablet nibs with weed wacker cable
snippets that are sanded afterwards. This thought alone blew my mind as I 
just have a cheapo Huion tablet I bought a few years ago which works just
fine on Linux with Krita and Grafx2. I think the current digital pen's nib 
is pretty used at this point, so I definitely am debating how to go about doing
this. Here's the specific 0.65" trimmer line that you can use to create your 
own DIY replacement nibs for digital drawing pens:

<p>
I watched so many Adrian Belew based videos this week, so I've been pretty
inspired to just keep doing music on the side. The guy's a genius in my 
opinion. Some of the old King Crimson 80's stuff is just mindblowing,
especially their 80's tour videos with the weird looping segments between songs.
Such cool stuff. Clips like that always make me want to get a Digitech JamMan 
Stereo from eBay to do some cool music loops.
</p>

<p>
Here's some King Crimson 80's vids at their peak, just great stuff:

<p>
I plan on possibly taking down my Bandcamp and Soundcloud pages, and just 
re-hosting it on this site. However, I will have to find a nice streamable 
media player that runs on a page. If that exists (which it probably does), 
then I'll be set, and depend on one less platform, which is always a good thing.
</p>

<p>
I might also however have a Donate button at the top of the related music in 
case the bandwidth caps out though ;).
</p>

<p>
I found some good ways to self-host audio streaming on my own site:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://opentape.fm/">http://opentape.fm/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/">http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nunzioweb.com/streaming_audio-example.htm">https://nunzioweb.com/streaming_audio-example.htm</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
On that "nunzioweb.com" site, I noticed how on this page, he was able to change
the CSS stylesheet on the fly, which is EXACTLY what I wanted to do. Time
to somehow copy his "setActiveStylesheet()" JS function ^_^
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://nunzioweb.com/index.shtml#top">https://nunzioweb.com/index.shtml#top</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
After careful examination of that page's "Network" tab, I believe I found the
source of the magical JS script that changes the stylesheet on the fly. I 
definitely am debating how I can adapt this to my site, very cool:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://nunzioweb.com/js/switchcontent2.js">https://nunzioweb.com/js/switchcontent2.js</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Other than that, I'm doing some cleanup on the "Programming" page and am
thinking more about the small React JS app I want to do to pull down
Yahoo! Finance stock data. I've been trying to get some of the older projects
running again, and realized that a lot of them would have been better suited
towards running them using 'venv' in a virtual environment to prevent having
to pull in Python 3 library dependencies for cron jobs.
</p>

<p>
Maybe I'll look into running a BBS or hosting an IRC server on this site, who
knows.
</p>

<p>
Just gonna chill out as far as I know though :).
</p>

<p>
Hope everyone is doing well.

I've been looking up more Hungarian food recipes to make this year.
</p>

<p>
Here's a great YouTube channel to learn how to make some Hungarian food, as the
recipes use both metric and Imperial measurements:

<p>
Here are two great YouTube channels on Hungarian cooking, but be warned,
they're both in Hungarian without any subtitles or captions, so I would 
recommend this only if you can understand Hungarian (like me):
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRxaYgjGaaxeQwmMwxQ2pGQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRxaYgjGaaxeQwmMwxQ2pGQ</a></li>

</ul>

<p>
I'm gonna chill out and check out some more Demo Scene art to see if I can
get ideas of what to make myself one of these weekends for fun.
</p>

<p>
I am also thinking about what to add to my Emacs config between all my machines.
</p>

<p>
I would like it so that the modeline at the bottom has more auto-completion.
Also, I would like to try making a few Hydra key combinations to make things a
bit easier. I might even learn some more Org Mode as well, who knows.
</p>

<p>
Still planning on finishing the Gentoo install this weekend, and am looking
forward to it :)

I began work on an AngularJS app to record callsigns for Ham Radio:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://musimatic.net/radio.html#callsign_recorder">https://musimatic.net/radio.html#callsign_recorder</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I plan on making it AngularJS based, and want an easy way to quickly
record callsigns and look them up on a related callsign lookup site.
</p>

<p>
I'm still debating the usefulness of it, as it would be cool to 
export the same data. However at the same time, instead of exporting
it to Excel or .txt formats, you could have easily made a similar 
list in your text editor of choice, so why bother exporting it?
</p>

<p>
However, that's where we can abuse the fact that its a web app in a 
browser since we can then create anchor links to easily get 
information about a person given their callsign for future contacts
(email address, etc.).
</p>

<p>
Here's the link for AngularJS for reference:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://angularjs.org/">https://angularjs.org/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I wasn't able to easily get a ham radio callsign lookup using the popular
ham radio site, QRZ.com, or even the FCC database. This is most likely 
because both sites most likely use AJAX calls to refresh the page without
refreshing the overall page. This means that the URL itself is never updated 
with your actual search query so you can't just build anchor links unfortunately. 
To see this in action, use your favorite search engine, and notice the "q=" 
variable for your search query change within the top URL as you progress 
throughout the site.
</p>

<p>
Also, I know for a fact that QRZ.com uses an API, which means that 
even if I were to apply for an API key even for a basic app, there's 
still the chance that someone might abuse my given API key with
60+ API calls per second. Plus, I hate API's so&#x2026; that's that.
</p>

<p>
It's always easier to just scrape data instead ^_^
</p>

<p>
However, I did find this jenky third party website that allows you to easily 
lookup ham's by their callsign without an API , so I'm just going to use that 
instead:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://hamcall.net/call?callsign">https://hamcall.net/call?callsign</a>=</li>
</ul>

<p>
It's gonna be fun :)
</p>

<p>
After that, I'm planning to make a React JS web app for a stock ticker 
to rip the top stocks from the the Yahoo! Finance stock tickers directly, or
through a Python 3 webscraper data pull.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to most likely have to re-arrange the "Programming" page to accommodate
this, but I can easily have a "web app" section near the top, and any of the archive
or Git repo related projects at the bottom, so it shouldn't be too hard.
</p>

<p>
I also have been browsing for some art to follow, and really trying to see what's out
there to push myself in what I am to be able to do.
</p>

<p>
Since its pretty obvious I'm into a lot of technical topics, there's a lot of
art that translates from the "Demo Scene" that relates to my interests, and the 
art I want to do. The "Demo Scene" is a bit hard to explain, but it basically
features computer based art for the most part. It also involves gatherings 
similar to LAN parties, but with mostly demos including computers, music, and art.
</p>

<p>
Here's some "Demo Scene" art website I found to be pretty cool:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://artcity.bitfellas.org/index.php">http://artcity.bitfellas.org/index.php</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.bitfellas.org/e107_plugins/radio/radio.php">http://www.bitfellas.org/e107_plugins/radio/radio.php</a></li>
<li><a href="http://janeway.exotica.org.uk/search.php?show=100&amp;query=&amp;what=0">http://janeway.exotica.org.uk/search.php?show=100&amp;query=&amp;what=0</a></li>
<li><a href="http://artcity.bitfellas.org/index.php?a=latestpictures">http://artcity.bitfellas.org/index.php?a=latestpictures</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
More so, if I could do Grafx2 style art in the vein of this guy, I would be
pretty happy with myself:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQQWMeQOZM8&amp;t=342s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQQWMeQOZM8&amp;t=342s</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Unfortunately, that "ProwlerGFX" guy is primarily on Facebook, which I don't
use at all, and his website is pretty non-functional at this point.
</p>

<p>
But, I will find similar artists in this style, and see how they were able
to get to this level as I really really really like scene based art a lot.
</p>

<p>
I believe I will get there to the art based apex I want. It's just that I have to keep 
practicing art on the weekends whenever I want to chill out. It's hard sometimes because
I burn out from the week easily, but I'll figure it out somehow.
</p>

<p>
I've made a few icons in Grafx2 for fun the other day, so that's a start haha.
</p>

<p>
Also, I would like to start recording for a new band this weekend so that will be 
fun too.
</p>

<p>
Happy to keep on going!

I got the actual K-Index and Sunspot data to display on the page itself, so that's
pretty cool. I also got the "K Index" graph to also display by using appropriate

<p>
Maybe something with open data feeds, not sure.
</p>

<p>
Was gonna mess around with the solderless breadboard setup I have to learn a
bit of electronics, but I was a bit dumb and forgot to buy a multimeter, as
well as a few ranges of resistors as I assumed the starter kit I got came with
everything.
</p>

<p>
Boy, was I wrong.
</p>

<p>
More so, I'm debating getting a Ardunino Uno copy from Amazon as well since 
its purpose is primarily for entry level electronics as well, and they're 
super cheap and run on USB powerbanks, so there's no risk of getting shocked
or anything while learning basic circuits.
</p>

<p>
I'd like to build up basic circuits, and maybe make a few small synths eventually.
</p>

<p>
Here's to learning,

I have been in the process of installing Gentoo. Though it has been fun and I have
learned so much throughout the process, the process itself is pretty long to the
point where I had to pause the KVM Virtual machine in Virt-Manager to continue
the process sometime later today. The IRC channel for Gentoo on Freenode 
has been SUPER  helpful though, and overall, the process has been so much better 
than trying to do the same thing for Arch or something. Plus they allow you 
totally ignore 'systemd' which is a backdoor to avoid putting on your system 
anyway. 
</p>

<p>
Though I haven't found any Librebooted computers worth getting yet, I still want to
move in that direction to maybe score a Thinkpad X60 or Thinkpad X200 on eBay
so I can libreboot it for that purpose. In the worst scenario, I could even
look into building a computer whose motherboard is Libreboot compatible as well.
</p>

<p>
I was looking into packet radio, and somehow found the "radio.garden" website,
which allows you to tune into radio stations throughout the world. It allows you
to move a virtual globe to select any nearby radio stations. They've even got
ones at "the ends of the earth" including an arctic radio station, which is
pretty neat. You can check it out here:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">

<p>
I found this packet radio network where they have created an IP-based digital
network for Ham Radio use, but it seems to be primarily in the Washington state
area. Though I have no plans at all to move to that part of the U.S., it is
pretty neat though. I would do love to run a similar mesh network through the 
South though, so it's definitely something to model after:

<p>
Sometime yesterday, I was doing a TON of research in credit card churning, and
how to go about doing it. I think it's a pretty valid thing to do, especially 
since the economy sucks for anyone like me in my generation that doesn't have 
any real estate, and is just continuously working week to week to just to pay 
bills, and get pretty much nothing else in return . Sure, I could blame boomers 
for basically rigging the real estate market for what it is now to the point 
where you can't even fathom how to own a reasonably priced house or even land 
for that matter sometimes without somehow having to convert a fixer-upper
property to make it somewhat affordable.
</p>

<p>
However, the positive way around that would be to just figure out how to play 
around those stupid barriers, and rig your current financial system for your
own benefit.
</p>

<p>
Though a lot of what you initially read about the credit card churning subject 
are articles by credit card companies telling you why its so bad, I have found 
so many different sources contrary to that narrative to the point where its 
pretty obvious that these same credit card companies don't want you doing it
in the first place. 
</p>

<p>
Sure, a lot of the deals are primarily based on travel points for flights, 
hotel stays, etc, so if you're not really intro travel, it's not THAT great. 
However, there are still good intro offers for a lot of credit cards to abuse 
with the minimum spending limit and to just cancel the card before the annual 
fee is charged, so if you plan it right and don't over do it, its not that bad. 
</p>

<p>
I'm not going to link to any credit card churning sources I found, since its
really really subjective, and is kind of YMMV (your mileage may vary), so its
not for everyone. All I know is that it would definitely work for me.
</p>

<p>
That being noted, I'm totally going to check it out as it looks like a good 
way to gain some extra cash on the side to maybe invest in a few stocks. It's the
best I could do before having to becoming some cryptocurrency shill or something. 
Even people who are into trying to find the next cryptocurrency just irk me because
they don't even use the coin itself, and just literally convert it back to dollars.
In that respect, the only reason to ever get into trading cryptocurrencies is
to abuse it for some kind of get rich quick scheme. You might as well try one
of those pyramid scheme type "Poor Dad, Rich Dad" seminars at that point since
both efforts would totally result in failure. 
</p>

<p>
I'm glad that I figured out that people are just into cryptocurrency for that 
reason alone, so its something to just avoid altogether.
</p>

<p>
In terms of stock tickers, I found a lot of good links for that purpose, which 
I might turn into a few dashboards on this site for later use with the help of 
some Python 3 based webscrapers.
</p>

<p>
A lot of the stock software I found was primarily Windows and Mac based, but
I DID happen to find some Linux based software (thankfully :/).
</p>

<p>
Here's a link for any Linux based financial software:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.linuxlinks.com/Financial/">https://www.linuxlinks.com/Financial/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The "JStock" Linux stock software alone looked pretty promising as well, so I
might considering figuring out how to use it as well:

<p>
An even cooler page is the "Oocities.org" website, which basically archived ALL
of the Geocities web pages before it got taken down.
</p>

<p>
This means that if you somehow remember your Geocities username, you can find
your site still active here:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://www.oocities.org/">http://www.oocities.org/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Here's a very nichey Super Mario themed Geocities site I found as well:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://oocities.org/itsamemario2000/english.html?202025">http://oocities.org/itsamemario2000/english.html?202025</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The reason I was looking into old Geocities sites is that I want my next 
re-design of this site to be Geocities themed.
</p>

<p>
Maybe, just maybe I can find my old Geocities page with all the Pokemon sprites
and icons.
</p>

<p>
That would be the day.
</p>

<p>
Also, I've been debating if I should move over to a VoIP setup since even though
I prefer the fliphone setup I currently have, even not having text would be ok
with me too.
</p>

<p>
Also, they're going to slowly get rid of 3G towers, so sadly I probably would
be forced to move over to a 4G phone eventually.
</p>

<p>
After that, I would DEFINITELY swap to a home phone at that point with an AX-25
enabled ham radio BBS node in the car to match haha.
</p>

<p>
These VoIP services were hard to find, but here's a list of potential VoIP 
services for personal use since a good chunk of them are geared towards business
use, and I think they're assuming every Zoomer would immediately prefer a 
cellphone (Side Node: I'm pretty surprised Vonage still exists):

GitHub is pretty much trash these days, but here is one cool thing I found from it:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted">https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Basically that link is a ton of apps and resources that you self-host yourself 
on sites like this.
</p>

<p>
That means, MORE IDEAS FOR APPS TO DEPLOY ON THIS SITE :)
</p>

<p>
I was already kind of just set on deploying Unrealircd to create a IRC server
to connect to via SSH key or password or something, but I'm glad to find more
ideas of things to deploy :D.
</p>

<p>
The only other thing I could think of was to maybe to create a email server,
and maybe even a public pastebin to link to code (without syntax of course to
prevent SQL injection attacks, or cross-site scripting via PHP scripts).
</p>

<p>
I still shudder when I think of when this site was hosted on a public hosted
server, and the dang PHP infested portion that appeared out of nowhere which was
a result of some hacker in India. Worst part about is that the shared hosting
provider, InMotion Hosting didn't even care, despite my multiple emails 
regarding the issue.
</p>

<p>
Let it be a lesson to anyone to NEVER pay for shared hosting. Always host your 
website yourself on a private VPS instance using a VPS service provider like 
Vultur, Digital Ocean, etc. You can be even more based by hosting it at your
own home using a single board computer (Raspberry Pi, etc) but you would
have to figure out a safe way to do port forwarding as well to not allow
the entire internet to access your home network though. With this in mind, 
make sure to do your research first before doing this option.
</p>

<p>
I've been working on hashing out ideas for that Solar Weather JQuery UI app as
I've had to learn more about what actual practical applications for showing solar
weather regarding Ham Radio's HF (high frequency) propagation.
</p>

<p>
The coolest thing I learned today was that after a solar flare, the ionosphere
will be loaded with more ions which BOOSTS your HF propagation to allow for
a much greater distance for contacts.
</p>

<p>
Now if I could just afford to buy a DMR radio (MD-UV-380), we would be set&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
And maybe then I could finally make a DX contact with Hungary :/
</p>

<p>
I have a few fun things planned for the weekend to relax, so I'm staying positive
as I can.
</p>

<p>
Been going through Book of Samuel (KJV) still between tickets at work sometimes 
when I need a boost.

I've been debating what I want to do in terms of a JQuery UI style App.
</p>

<p>
I'm leaning towards using the JQuery UI "Accordian" widget to make some kind 
of expandable web app.
</p>

<p>
I found two cool NOAA based directories to either obtain JSON and image data from:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/json/">https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/json/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/images/">https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/images/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Here's the overarching site if you're interested in other forms of data from
the NOAA server, which is neat since you don't have to apply for an API
key in order to utilize their data:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/content/data-access">https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/content/data-access</a></li>

</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://musimatic.net/radio.html#space_weather">https://musimatic.net/radio.html#space_weather</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Also, a LOT of ideas can be gleaned in terms of space based weather for use 
in Ham Radio on this site I found from QRZ, which is CONSTANTLY being linked
on personal ham radio enthusiast pages:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://www.hamqsl.com/solar.html">http://www.hamqsl.com/solar.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I've also been playing around with some ROM hacking via some related utilities
from this site:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://www.romhacking.net/">http://www.romhacking.net/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
One ROM hacking utility that worked right from the get-go using WINE in Linux was 
"YY-CHR" which allows you to open up a related ROM file, and just edit sprites 
right away, which was super cool:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/119/">https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/119/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Now what kind of ROM hack I would make&#x2026; that I'm not sure. But I'll admit, it
is super cool how easy it is to just open up a game's sprites and just have at it
so I'll come up with something cool I guess.
</p>

<p>
Way easier than attempting to make a game in some constantly shilled engine 
like Unity or something.
</p>

<p>
Probably will make a ROM hack for Gameboy Color ;)
</p>

<p>
I've been debating what separate piano songs to learn, so I've taken a look
at some video game based sheet music:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.ninsheetmusic.org/browse/console/N64">https://www.ninsheetmusic.org/browse/console/N64</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Also, I got Qemu to load up on the Linux Desktop, so I'm planning on installing
Gentoo in a VM this weekend when I get a chance.
</p>

<p>
Looking forward to learning some more hands-on Linux skills, and finally taking 
the Gentoo challenge.
</p>

<p>
Keep having fun :)

I got my Jitsi instance running.
</p>

<p>
However, it's only usable using a Chromium variant browser. Because I despise 
Google, I've had to resort to using Ungoogled Chromium which works flawlessly
for Jitsi thankfully.
</p>

<p>
There are a TON of Firefox issues for Jitsi-Meet, so I don't feel bad at all
why Firefox doesn't work, since its a known issue, and there's no known
workaround:

I basically followed this blog post to deploy a Jitsi instance on this
site for anyone wanting to do it on their Debian VPS server:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://nerdonthestreet.com/wiki?find=Host+a+Jitsi+Meet+Server">https://nerdonthestreet.com/wiki?find=Host+a+Jitsi+Meet+Server</a></li>

Also, if you ever need to troubleshoot the related technology, aka
"WebRTC", there's a test site to test your webcam and mic setup:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://test.webrtc.org/">https://test.webrtc.org/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I also got my Desktop machine back and running with its video card plugged in, so now
I'm just trying to move my dotfiles back on the machine before proceeding with
using 'qemu' to install Gentoo in a VM.
</p>

<p>
The command that I used to obtain the dotfiles on the Desktop machine is:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">git clone git@git.musimatic.net:/var/www/git/dotfiles.git
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Also, apparently, you can shorten the URL itself by adding this to 
the "~/.ssh/config" as well:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">Host git
HostName git.musimatic.net
User git
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now if I can only get GNU Stow to work to just stow away my dotfiles properly&#x2026;

I've been trying to get the Searx instance running, but it appears that the 
"filtron" component is the part that is doing excessive rate-limiting for some
reason.
</p>

<p>
I'll have to lurk on their IRC channel to maybe get some feedback of what to do.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of IRC, I found a couple of links that are interesting and useful
as well to find IRC networks OTHER than Freenode:

Been also debating the best ham radio setup as well, since I might just get one
of those meme-y type 40 inch antennas for my HT (Baofeng UV-5R) to improve my
signal strength to hit a few more repeaters for like $20.
</p>

<p>
We'll see.

Debating what kind of web app I should create, either with JQuery UI, or

I've been playing around with KiwiSDR, which is another "Software Defined Radio"

I changed the "favicon" for my site to be a cool neat lightning bolt I customized
myself, which you'll see at the top of each tab.
</p>

<p>
The fact that it had the old stupid "InMotion" favicon bothered the heck out
of me recently, so I decided it was time to get rid of it once and for all.
</p>

<p>
I originally tried using this site to create the favicon using some example
Pokemon sprites:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://favicomatic.com/">https://favicomatic.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
However, I realized this site was a little bit easier to use, allowed you to
edit it on the fly, and even allowed you to export it:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.favicon.cc/">https://www.favicon.cc/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm pretty happy with the results, as icon work brings back such good feelings, 
and remind me of fun Geocities pages, especially my old one.
</p>

<p>
Now if I could just find my old email and dig up my Geocities name and find the
associated site, and bring it back to life!
</p>

<p>
Now THAT would be something!

I found a Budapest, Hungary based SDR to check out for anyone interested in Hungarian Ham Radio:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://pet.no-ip.biz:5050/">http://pet.no-ip.biz:5050/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I've been trying multiple Hungarian based Echolink repeaters, but can't seem to
get a QSO with any Hungarian Ham Radio Operators yet unfortunately.
</p>

<p>
It must be a timezone thing, or maybe Echolink just isn't as popular in Europe.
</p>

<p>
I've been debating getting a DMR based radio with a PiStar node (either my 
existing Raspberry Pi 3, or get a Raspberry Pi Zero later).
</p>

<p>
The idea is that you can hook up a DMR radio to a Pi-Star hotspot, and then
connect with radio towers across the world, much like Echolink, but with
an actual radio instead of a headset, which is pretty dang neat.
</p>

<p>
I can't say I have the $200 or so to even do this setup right now unfortunately due to just
making enough right now to pay the bills, however, it something to consider down the line.
</p>

<p>
I bought a breadboard for electronics based stuff, but forgot to get a related battery for it, GO FIGURE ha!
</p>

<p>

Anyway, keeping my mind occupied with the site, and happy I still have it. I'll keep thinking of cool sections to add,
and also the grand ol' re-design I've done every year. This year, I plan on doing a Geocities themed makeover, so it's 
gonna be rad.

I found out how to use 'mpv' to display videos in a terminal using the following
command:
mpv &#x2013;vo=caca (name of video)
</p>

<p>
It'll look like something similar to this, but you can least view videos on 
lower-spec computers in terminal without a problem:

<p>
Makes me want to start a "TTY" or "X-less" based blog where I just PURELY use
terminal based programs, and don't rarely boot into X. Now THAT sounds like fun
^_^.

<p>
Keep having fun :)

I found out about "SDR", which is Software Defined Radio through someone who 
talked about this on IRC.
</p>

<p>
This is better explained on the SDR website found here:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://www.websdr.org/">http://www.websdr.org/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Also, there are other ways to listen to Ham Radio online, so check out this link:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.hamradiosecrets.com/listen-to-ham-radio-online.html">https://www.hamradiosecrets.com/listen-to-ham-radio-online.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Just give the SDR's below a shot by loading one of the links below in a modern 
GUI based web browser, and play around with the tuner (yellow icon) to change 
the frequency. You can also change the "band" to change the different wavelength 
bands as well. Also, you can listen to basic FM/AM radio too if you're into that 
sort of thing.
</p>

<p>
Here's the list of web-based SDR's I found:
</p>

<p>
Washington DC Area Based Web SDR:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://na5b.ddns.net:8901/">http://na5b.ddns.net:8901/</a></li>

Northern Utah Area Based Web SDR:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://www.sdrutah.org/">http://www.sdrutah.org/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Milford, PA Based Web SDR:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://k3fef.com:8901/">http://k3fef.com:8901/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Currently debating between two separate radios, both of which can be programmed
easily via CHIRP:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Anytone AT-778</li>
<li>Anytone 5888</li>
</ul>

<p>
I've also been looking into how to properly connect to BBS's via this link:

<p>
Still deciding on how to best do this as you can easily just have it run every five seconds with
a "setTimeout()" JS function.
</p>

<p>
Also, I would like to do this via an AJAX request via a button too if possible which would be cool.
</p>

<p>
We'll see.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise, still looking for a $200 mid-tier Ham Radio since I'll be able to get a free J-Pole antenna 
and power supply from two different Ham's in the area. Looking for one that can be easily programmed with 
CHIRP software, but can reach repeaters in the area.
</p>

<p>
I think I'll keep myself occupied with Echolink via QTel for the time being though while I keep doing my related 
research.
</p>

<p>
Also, I'm looking into VoIP based services to make internet calls with cordless or corded old-school phones, since
I pretty much am fed up with using cellphones these days.
</p>

<p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2754eee">
<p>
I did a lot of backend website modifications, including re-ordering of my Git repos
for my projects.
</p>

<p>
Though I haven't gotten all of the older projects up and running, one particular 
new project I have up is the ISS Location Receiver based script that pulls in the
longitude, latitude, and Unix timestamp of when the ISS Space Station is overhead.
</p>

<p>
This means that you can monitor it going over your house over the course of
the day.
</p>

<p>
For now, you can pipe in these longitude, and latitude coordinates into a search 
engine to figure out where it currently is.
</p>

<p>
You can find out more about the "ISS-Location-Now" API through the documentation
here:
<a href="http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/">http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/</a>
</p>

<p>
I'm planning on somehow incorporating this with "Leaflet" to provide a real-time
map in a webpage as well to keep it relevant:
<a href="https://leafletjs.com/">https://leafletjs.com/</a>
</p>

<p>
Anyway, you have to celebrate the small wins, as this helped me learn how to
save a JSON request file ("iss<sub>location.json</sub>") locally, and each time
you press the "Click Here To Display Current ISS Space Station", an AJAX request
is performed so only that portion of the page is refreshed.
</p>

<p>
This means that it doesn't have to reload the page in order to display JUST that
information since it pulls all of the information from the JSON file that I
obtain every minute via the Python 3 based requests module.
</p>

<p>
Keep having fun,

I've been getting more into Ham Radio recently, and it has been super cool.
</p>

<p>
The license exam itself is kind of useless for someone like me that is using
a low-tier handheld radio, as the questions are geared towards older enthusiasts
who have amples amounts of money to build radio towers on their property, with
a $500 to $1000 radio to match.
</p>

<p>
However, once you kind of get past the somewhat useless exam which encompasses
a good majority of high school level physics, its not too bad.
</p>

<p>
Would recommend "hamstudy.org" for anyone interested as it has the SAME exact
question pool as what's on the test, and it is what I used to study for the exam:
<a href="https://hamstudy.org/">https://hamstudy.org/</a>
</p>

<p>
The possibilities of using packet radio, BBS's, and Echolink (via QTel) has
been really fun to play with. So far, I've received a ton of support from 
Ham's in the Echolink based net calls, since the Ham's near me don't really 
do much packet radio. Most people online kind of dismiss packet radio as
a "fad from the 90's". I, however, see it differently as the potential of
using a mesh network to connect devices such as computers across the world
without having a centralized ISP dictating everything is MIND BLOWING.
</p>

<p>
Of course, a lot of these kind of mesh networks are limited to Hams, but hey,
just get the basic Technician level license, and you're set.
</p>

<p>
I've expanded to the world of VoIP over Echolink, which allows you to basically
to anyone throughout the world that has a Ham radio license via the internet. 
It might sound like Skype to some people, but is way less proprietary or invasive
privacy-wise. Though you might be thinking, "Yeah, isn't that kind of dangerous?", 
I honestly have not heard nothing but positive people that are super encouraging. 
The ham radio hobby attracts very tech minded individuals, so its not anything 
weird like in a strange internet chat room or something since its FCC regulated. 
</p>

<p>
Also, you have to keep in mind that although you are accessing these radio towers
via the internet, a lot of them are PHYSICAL radio towers which are repeating
your same radio signal throughout a PHYSICAL region. With this in mind, people
aren't as open as you would think, and are pretty polite with each other as a 
result. Plus, most of the topics discussed are pretty much centered around the 
hobby itself. Honestly, a good chunk of the people I spoke to so far are just 
retired individuals that are looking for positive conversations throughout a 
given day. I've heard it all from what people are doing at a given moment, such
as errands, fishing, etc, to just talking for minutes about a given topic, which
is called "rag chewing" in Ham lingo.
</p>

<p>
Echolink can be found here, but NOTE: You NEED to have a callsign registered
with the FCC in order to use it, so you CANNOT use it unless you are a licensed
Ham:
<a href="http://echolink.org/">http://echolink.org/</a>
</p>

<p>
It's primarily aimed for Windows users, but you can also utilize "QTel" if
you have a Debian based Linux computer via your "apt" package manager:
<a href="https://pkgs.org/download/qtel">https://pkgs.org/download/qtel</a>
</p>

<p>
I learned that there are "net calls" which are basically group calls that occur
once every week on a given topic. I was pretty surprised that there are 
several net calls around very specific medical based ailments on certain 
frequency bands, so that was something I never knew people actually did with 
ham radio. 
</p>

<p>
For example, one guy was going on about how there's a stomach based net for 
ham's who suffer from stomach ailments, so its kind of like mini-support groups 
for given topics. However, though I mentioned medical based topics, net calls
span a whole range of topics. For example, I listened into a Raspberry Pi based 
net call, and learned SO MUCH more about Linux with radio than even on IRC. 
I absolutely will tune in next week at the same time slot, since I want
to learn more and more to expand my base knowledge on the topic.
</p>

<p>
In terms of this website, I've taken care of a few minor things, including:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Revised my GitWeb site to include a dark theme CSS stylesheet:</li>
</ol>
<p>
<a href="http://git.musimatic.net/">http://git.musimatic.net/</a>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I've been able to make two of my existing project sites work again after the</li>
</ol>
<p>
recent NGINX backend upgrade:
<a href="https://musimatic.net/pythonprojectwebsites/Bandcamper/tags.html">https://musimatic.net/pythonprojectwebsites/Bandcamper/tags.html</a>
<a href="https://musimatic.net/pythonprojectwebsites/ScriptureOfTheDay/output.html">https://musimatic.net/pythonprojectwebsites/ScriptureOfTheDay/output.html</a>
</p>

<p>
The remaining goal would be to maybe get some of these other project websites
running.
</p>

<p>
However, projects like my "ExpressOrLocalApp", though cool when I first made it, 
wouldn't benefit anyone since everyone's leaving NYC nowadays anyway, so 
it might not even be worth it to get that specific project website working again.
</p>

<p>
The cooler thing would be to start running a BBS or something, and roll with
it. That and run a "Searx" instance, run a "UnrealIRC" instance, etc.
</p>

<p>
Or maybe, even get the page looking like an old Geocities or Angelfire site like
this for example (without the dreary gothic theme, but you get the point):
<a href="https://gothicnight.com/login.html">https://gothicnight.com/login.html</a>
</p>

<p>
I've been working on getting the "ISS Location" page running, so that's been
fun, so far I've been working on making sure the JSON request saves properly
so that I can run an AJAX request with the push of a &lt;button&gt; tag on the
page to pull the latest JSON response that's downloaded to the same
directory via a crontab job:
<a href="https://musimatic.net/radio.html">https://musimatic.net/radio.html</a>
</p>

<p>
I've been toying with the idea of possibly creating a "Lode Runner" game
but based on someone else's game, change out the sprite sheet, and
have it running on a JavaScript based engine so I can run it in browser 
on a page, and across multiple devices.
</p>

<p>
That alone would be pretty cool imo.
</p>

<p>
You can play Lode Runner for free on Internet Archive (archive.org) on
multiple old-school computer emulator platforms IN BROWSER:
Mac Version:
<a href="https://archive.org/details/mac_Lode_Runner">https://archive.org/details/mac_Lode_Runner</a>

DOS Version (Sequel):
<a href="https://archive.org/details/LodeRunnerTheLegendReturns">https://archive.org/details/LodeRunnerTheLegendReturns</a>
</p>

<p>
I've also been trying to get Retropie working to use Amiga, Macintosh, and
DOS based emulators.
</p>

<p>
So far, I've been able to boot Retropie without a problem. However, if I
try to run any Amiga games, even with the necessary "kick" (BIOS) roms
present in the proper directory, it boots into a black screen.
</p>

<p>
However, it'll be pretty dang sweet when I get some cool Amiga, Mac, and DOS
software running on the old Raspberry Pi 3 I have, since its been a while
since I used it. I really do like the Retropie menu a lot. I think the last
project I tried doing with that box was "DietPi" which was ok, but I'd rather
get some kind of old desktop computer, put a super lightweight Linux distro
on it, and run it as a Desktop computer with just a TTY prompt without running
X. 
</p>

<p>
Now THAT would be a cool challenge.
</p>

<p>
I've been trying to find a cool old broken Macintosh from the 80's to house
my Raspberry Pi 3 in, but I can't find a good deal for one on eBay or locally
since every older dude knows EXACTLY what they're selling, regardless if its
broken or not. The idea would be to just remove the guts of the old PC, fit
in a new monitor in the front panel of the Mac, and get a glorious BBS running
or something.
</p>

<p>
THIS is what I would love to do, but don't really have the kind of eBay money
to do so:

</p>

<p>
Looking forward to possibly installing Gentoo in a VM, but I STILL am unpacking
boxes from the move (go figure), so I would need to find the screws for the video
card so I can remount it to the Desktop machine I have.
</p>

<p>
Staying positive, and still doing my thing (which is, having fun :D).

<p>
Stay well,

I changed the CSS of this page to be a tad bit simpler as the solarized theme
for the CSS was a bit much.
</p>

<p>
Pretty happy to get back to the whole dark blue purple theme, so I'm pretty set.
</p>

<p>
Might add some small tweaks with fonts, but the simpler the better as I plan on
overhauling the theme to like a Geocities-type old school theme at the end of the
year as well.
</p>

<p>
I was able to find my Desktop computer in my moving boxes with the power cable,
but need to dig in other boxes for the screws for the video card, as well 
as the TV I've been using forever as the monitor for it.
</p>

<p>
That being noted, I'll probably get to trying to install Gentoo in a VM another time
in that case.
</p>

<p>
I've been trying to schedule a remote-based Technician level ham radio 
license exam. The earliest I was able to schedule it is in the second week of October,
which slightly sucks, but I might be able to schedule it sooner with one of the other
two remote based ham radio clubs that are running the exams remotely.
</p>

<p>
I've been pretty much consistently passing the practice exams online, so it shouldn't
be too bad. 
</p>

<p>
However, the requirements of most of the remote exams minus ONE of them include the 
requirement to use Zoom, which sucks since its basically glorified spyware, but I'll just
smack it on my work computer so I don't have to risk a test procter getting mad about me
running it in a VM or something since a lot of the remote tests are kind of vague about
using VM's to run Zoom.
</p>

<p>
The main formulas to remember for the Technician-level Ham Radio License Exam include:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>E = I * R</li>
</ol>
<p>
OR with its units:
V = A * O
</p>

<p>
This would be Energy (E)  = Current (I) * Resistance (R)
</p>

<p>
Also, the second portion regarding the involved units include: V = Volts, A = Amps, O = Ohms
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li value="2">P = I * E</li>
</ol>
<p>
OR with its units:
W = A * V
</p>

<p>
This would be Power (P) = Current (I) * Energy (E)
</p>

<p>
Also, the second portion regarding the involved units include: W = Watts, A = Amps, V = Volts
</p>

<p>
Everything else, despite what anyone else says online, is basically just memorization of answers,
since someone like me is only planning to utilize the junky Chinese type handheld radios like the 
Baofeng UV-5R to make contacts locally, and even if I DO like the whole hobby, I'll probably
only get a CB type radio at best for like around $200. I kind of laugh when I see these boomer type
prices on eBay for like OK looking ham radios for like $500+, so I'm only skimming the surface of the
hobby for fun, and not planning to invest too much into it.
</p>

<p>
In terms of Emacs Org Mode, I learned that if you want to change an ordered list item to have a different
index, you would use: (number of item) '[@(new index number)]'
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Cool Thing To Do</li>
<li>Second Cool Thing To Do</li>
</ol>

<p>
Could Become:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Cool Thing To Do</li>
<li value="3">Third Cool Thing To Do</li>
</ol>

<p>
I've been taking it easy otherwise as there's still a few errands that need to be done after settling into
the new place over the course of the month.
</p>

<p>
I'm looking forward to cooking a lot of Hungarian and Vietnamese food to keep my mind occupied despite
the times, since the days and weeks are pretty much blending at this point, which sucks on a personal 
level, but there's not much else that can be done.
</p>

<p>
I'm definitely still thinking of useful things I can add to this site as well, including mini sub-pages
would benefit people like myself who are getting interested in ham radio, as well as Linux based info.
</p>

<p>
Stay thankful, and happy for the things you have today.

<p>
I did a very big move recently, and we just got all of our stuff settled into the new place.
</p>

<p>
It's been great so far, and pretty laid back comparatively.
</p>

<p>
However, its been a lot of ups and downs regarding how to rent a house, so I can't say its been too
easy, but I've been grateful that we made it in one piece and are closer to family given these 
crazy times.
</p>

<p>
After a few weeks of just chilling out after work so I don't burn out, I realized my efforts in terms 
of learning any tech stuff on the side should be focused on what I can apply directly into actual projects.
</p>

<p>
For example, instead of doing the related JS book from start to finish, I think I just need to read through
a related chapter, see what's applicable, and make a part of this actual site that features that capability instead
of working on silly fake websites that would be used as part of some "portfolio" or something.
</p>

<p>
Even as far as portfolio websites are concerned, I'm pretty sure if you can deploy a Wordpress site, you're
pretty much close to doing anything similar, so I might actually devote some time deploying some small
tinkering Wordpress (WP) sites in that case to gain that skill.
</p>

<p>
As far as the work based ElectronJS app I've been working on, I plan on just following some YouTube tutorials,
see what sticks, and just apply it to the app itself as its not rocket science.
</p>

<p>
I've been also working on getting my ham radio license, and figuring out what I'd like to do with the yard gardening
wise since I do have a garage to get some projects done now.
</p>

<p>
Also, I'm posting some useful Emacs based Org Mode shortcuts for anyone who does finances like myself in Org Mode as well:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">C-x-h: Select everything on screen
C-c-|: Turn the entire Org document into an Org-Mode table
C-c-<span style="color: #e0211d; text-decoration: overline;">}</span>: Turn on row and column numbers to make formulas easier<span style="color: #4f97d7; font-weight: bold;"> in</span> Org-Mode
M-S-Left: Delete a column
C-c-^: Sort a column based on the provided choices <span style="color: #e0211d; text-decoration: overline;">(</span>Note: Do this<span style="color: #4f97d7; font-weight: bold;"> in</span> the Date column based cell for an easy date sort<span style="color: #e0211d; text-decoration: overline;">)</span>

I have been in the process of trying to deploy a 'Searx' instance on this site, but so far, I
haven't made much progress and am kind of stuck on why its always stating "Rate limit exceeded"
when you attempt to visit the Searx instance via the 'curl' Linux terminal command.
</p>

<p>
I've been trying to utilize this part of the Searx official documentation guide and a related
GitHub issue that has a very close nginx based configuration for the 'searx' site but haven't really
figured out the root cause of the issue as I've followed each of the installation steps VERY closely:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://asciimoo.github.io/searx/admin/installation-nginx.html">https://asciimoo.github.io/searx/admin/installation-nginx.html</a></li>

</ul>

<p>
Only other thing I noted this weekend is that "invidio.us" looks like its going to taken down in September 2020, 
which sucks because I try to access YouTube through that instance to pull down videos for later viewing so that 
I don't get a million tracked ads while on YouTube.
</p>

<p>
It is 10x better to watch content locally on your computer than having to stream and potentially deal with ads and
the like. Also, watching videos locally with 'mpv' is amazing. I just hope someone forks the "Invidio" project here, 
and keeps it going so that I can keep checking out content on YouTube with a minimal browser like w3m:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/iv-org/invidious">https://github.com/iv-org/invidious</a></li>

<p>
There are other public instances of "Invidious", but who knows how long these will last if the main project
will end in September:

I'm back to just using regular Emacs.
</p>

<p>
I tried Doom Emacs out, and what bugged me is that the overall community's sentiment towards it
is correct. Doom Emacs is really just someone else's config. Sure it might be faster than regular
Emacs, but at least I know how I want my Emacs experience to be configured.
</p>

<p>
Also, using Doom Emacs with Org-Mode kind of sucks since the C-u C-c C-. command doesn't work right
at all, which is SUPER crucial for my every-day ticket based work at my actual job.
</p>

<p>
Hence, I nuked Doom's configs and am back to plain Emacs. The one thing I did like was the auto-completion
sections within the mini-buffer at the bottom of Emacs, as well as the recently found files part in the
intro-menu.
</p>

<p>
Other than that, eh.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, here's some cool links to check out for old-school style internet fun, or just fun in a Linux terminal:
</p>

<p>
Here's a cool old site from the early days of the Internet as I found this randomly after searching for "Tera Melos" online, worth it to check out
as his page is pretty extensive:

From the guy who made 'wttr.in' which is that cool Weather based internet service I've used for the "Weather" tab
on my site, this person listed some pretty neat console services that I found to be cool:

<p>
The "Telnet/SSH-based games:" section is pretty cool too, so all you have to do is run the following commands
in a Linux terminal to play some neat games via 'ssh', 'nc', or 'telnet':

I was able to figure out with the help of IRC how to actually git clone my repos as the 'git' user:
</p>

<p>
For example, if I had SSH access to my VPS on another machine, then I could do:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">git clone -v git@www.musimatic.net:/var/www/git/dotfiles.git
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Also, I learned how to configure Virtualbox on a Windows 10 'host' to run Devuan inside of it as the 'guest' with the help of this guide:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-virtualbox-guest-additions-on-debian-10/">https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-virtualbox-guest-additions-on-debian-10/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The only other tweak I had to do was make sure that in Virtualbox, I had went into Settings (Gear Icon) &gt; Display &gt; Graphics Controller: VMSVGA
</p>

<p>
Pretty stoked because I decked out the Devuan based virtual machine on my Windows 10 work computer with my dotfiles config, which means
I can potentially work primarily in a Linux environment in the near future and never have to touch Windoze for work ever again unless in a VM or
something locally on that machine.

I am happy to note that my git repos are live at the following site:
<a href="https://git.musimatic.net/">https://git.musimatic.net/</a>
</p>

<p>
What does this mean?
</p>

<p>
You can see the progress of any of my own public repos that I contribute to, so that you can steal my 'dotfiles' configurations for your own use
to tweak for example.
</p>

<p>
For example, I will literally be able to go to another machine, pull down related configurations, and it would look exactly like my current
machine without any problems.
</p>

<p>
I've been at this for a dang week, and I'm happy to note that its all because I had to be inclusive of ports INCLUDING port 80, which is the specific
port that helps handle HTTP requests on the web.
</p>

<p>
Because the lack of Nginx docs or guides on how to specifically configure "GitWeb" to work, I'm literally going to copy and paste my working config
so that anyone using 'nginx' can benefit from it as I had to use over 5 different separate guides to even attempt to figure it out:
</p>

<p>
NOTE: You'll have to place this in your '/etc/nginx/sites-available' directory on your website's VPS as a file name of your choose, for ex:
you can save it as 'git':
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python3">server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        server_name git.musimatic.net www.git.musimatic.net;

        location / {
                root /usr/share/gitweb;
                index index.cgi;
        }

        location /index.cgi {
                root /usr/share/gitweb/;
                include fastcgi_params;
                gzip off;
                fastcgi_param SCRIPT_NAME $uri;
                fastcgi_param GITWEB_CONFIG /etc/gitweb.conf;
                fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/fcgiwrap.socket;
        }

I am in the process of trying to figure out how to get the Git bare repos online as public repos on this site.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the Git book is mostly 'Apache2' based, which doesn't help because this site is now running using 'nginx'.
</p>

<p>
However I did find a couple links that I have to go through to make some decisions on how to properly configure and serve the following directory:
git.musimatic.net
</p>

<p>
I'm also debating whether or not I should even serve the Git repos in
the <i>var/www</i> directory on this site as well or keep to using the
/srv/git repo as mentioned in the Git book.
</p>

<p>
Helpful reference links on how to possibly do this include:

Things To To Do This Weekend:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Work on my C based ncurses project as well.</li>
<li>Learn more JS for work and keep utilizing this practice site as a means to apply the techniques from the related chapter: <a href="https://musimatic.net/FakeWebsites/PageCeption/index.html">https://musimatic.net/FakeWebsites/PageCeption/index.html</a></li>
<li>Work on my "ArmoryApp" NodeJS / Electron based app for work as well. It's coming along pretty nicely as I'm able to automatically pull logs for the one app I help do tech support for, which is pretty cool.</li>
<li>Configure the Devuan work based VM so I can move all my work inside of it.</li>
<li>Keep researching how to install Gentoo and configure the related installation guide.</li>
<li>Deploy 'Searx' public instance on this site now that I have the desired 'nginx' + 'Debian' combo that's preferred</li>
<li>Make Awk script to sort ~/.w3m/bookmark.html based on &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; tags present</li>
<li>Make LinkedIn Job Scraper based on their API so I don't have to use LinkedIn anymore +10k points for making an NCURSES interface to read results afterwards</li>
<li>Learn more from gotbletu videos</li>
<li>Work on weather based webscraper based on attr.in, and the National Weather Service Apache server to display the contents on a webpage</li>
<li>Turn Emacs into a C based IDE with this guide: <a href="https://martinsosic.com/development/emacs/2017/12/09/emacs-cpp-ide.html">https://martinsosic.com/development/emacs/2017/12/09/emacs-cpp-ide.html</a></li>

I am happy to note that this site is now running on 'nginx' thanks to Luke Smith's
video on the topic:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWAqilIVNgE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWAqilIVNgE</a>
</p>

<p>
Pretty stoked because dealing with Apache configurations was a bit of a pain, especially
since I wanted to add a Git server to this site, as well as Searx.
</p>

<p>
We are now running on a Debian 10 based VPS droplet running on Digital Ocean's VPS servers
in NY :).
</p>

<p>
I've been meaning to do this for a very long time, so I'm pretty glad.
</p>

<p>
I finished learning C, and went through that ncurses guide. I've been modifying two or more
projects to get the hang of it, and am basically making a glorified menu that runs a few
Git commands, which is about it.
</p>

<p>
Does it work yet? Not really.
</p>

<p>
Can I show it off yet? Not yet, because I'd need to setup the Git server first.
</p>

<p>
However, because I'm now using Debian 10 on this box, it should be way easier to do it
than friggin' Ubuntu was.
</p>

<p>
Plus, since I now have the great combo of 'nginx' + Debian 10, this means I can finally
revisit being able to host my own Searx instance as well so stay tuned for that.
</p>

<p>
Other than that, I've been debating making a LinkedIn Job Webscraper that would access the
LinkedIn Job API since I hate logging into that site, and be constantly spammed with unnecessary
news articles.
</p>

<p>
LinkedIn, like other platforms, needs to learn its place, and just stick to jobs, and nothing else.

Regarding My Digital Art:
</p>
</strong>

<p>
I got good news in that I was able to finally get around to modify the existing

<p>
Regarding 'Audacity':
</p>
</strong>

<p>
I tried to get Audacity to work on my Devuan laptop, but attempting to do
overdub tracks made weird sounds on the overdubbed track. I don't think it's
due to CPU issues present, but I'll see if I can just at least record demos
with Audacity on the desktop instead. It would have been nice to do demos
on the fly with the laptop alongside my Focusrite Solo (2nd gen) audio
interface, and then master songs in Reaper on the desktop later, but ah well.
</p>

<p>
So that would have to be the third fail of the week, but ah well, good and
bad things happen in 3's, so I'm hoping that stupid bad luck spree is over.
</p>

<strong>
<p>
Regarding 'GNU Stow':
</p>
</strong>

<p>
I re-arranged my dotfiles config and plan on deploying them with GNU Stow,
so that I can go to another machine, and use the following stow command so
I can deploy configuration dotfiles easily:
</p>

<p>
stow -t ~ *
</p>

<p>
This basically sets the target directory as the '~/' or $HOME directory where
normally all your dotfiles are located anyway since I usually place my dotfiles
in its own repo, ex: ~/programming/dotfiles. By doing this, Stow would properly
place them into the home directory on the target machine.
</p>

<p>
This helps a lot if you want to have your nice looking AwesomeWM or Openbox config
to be present in two seconds on a newly installed machine.
</p>

I'd like to probably overhaul the design of this blog post portion of my site
since solarize themes aren't really my thing anymore, but I at least got to figure
out how to change the CSS styling of an Emacs Org-Mode document. This is important
since that's all this page is at the end of the day, just an blog.html file that
was exported from the 'blog.org' file. It's hilarious that you can just make a website
using an Org mode file, and I still plan on carrying the torch as there's no really
big reason for wasting extra time in configuring HTML/CSS with JS just for blog posts
anyway.
</p>

<strong>
<p>
Regarding 'Emacs Org-Mode' Being Used For Finance Based CSV's:
</p>
</strong>

<p>
First of all, I've been using 'sc-im' to do my finances for the past few months. I first
attempted to document my attempts of the commands I wanted to do on each of the CSV files
involved in the process, which include the credit card and checking account statement CSV files.
However, after combing through the 'sc-im' internal help a few times, and their GitHub page, it
doesn't seem that there's an easy way to do commands like 'dc' or "Delete Column" with external
scripting at all.
</p>

<p>
I then got the idea that if I like Emacs so much, then why the heck SHOULDN'T I use it for CSV
spreadsheets either.
</p>

<p>
Then, I realized after a little bit of searching that you can easily make your finance .csv files
into Org-Mode tables by opening up the .csv file in Emacs, select all the values, copy it into your
copy / paste buffer, and then paste the values into a new .org document.
</p>

<p>
Then, in the .org document, highlight all of the values, and then use the following command:
</p>

<p>
C-c |
</p>

<p>
This turns the entire sheet into an Org-Mode table, which is sweet!
</p>

<p>
I learned this from this Stack Overflow post:
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1241581/emacs-import-a-csv-into-org-mode">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1241581/emacs-import-a-csv-into-org-mode</a>
</p>

<p>
Since I wanted to learn how formulas in Emacs Org Mode tables work, I also learned that the following
command will turn on row and column numbers to make formulas easier in Org-Mode:
</p>

<p>
C-c }
</p>

<p>
More info on how spreadsheet formulas work in Emacs Org-Mode can be found here:
<a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-spreadsheet-intro.html">https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-spreadsheet-intro.html</a>
</p>

<p>
Very happy to be moving on past 'sc-im' for this purpose alone. 'sc-im' neat for basic spreadsheets but
was just a bit disappointing in terms of its scripting ability to manipulate existing .csv files but
I guess there's other terminal programs for that purpose too.

I debated installing 'firefox-esr' since Qutebrowser just wasn't working
with YouTube's sign in page at all. It turns out that the dumb blanket
error message they give when you try logging into YouTube with Qutebrowser,
"you're using "a browser [&#x2026;] that doesn't allow us to keep your account secure"
is totally a lie.
</p>

<p>
They just want more control over your browsing experience to monitor your viewing
habits, and to make ad revenue, plain and simple. This is explained more in detail
within the following workaround found here from Qutebrowser's GitHub page:
<a href="https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/5182">https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/5182</a>
</p>

<p>
Here's the workaround you have to use within Qutebrowser itself to make it
work with YouTube's Google Sign-In page:
:set -u <a href="https://accounts.google.com/">https://accounts.google.com/</a>* content.headers.user<sub>agent</sub> 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86<sub>64</sub>; rv:57.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/57.0'
</p>

<p>
What does this workaround do?
</p>

<p>
From the looks of it, it utilizes a Mozilla based agent that makes it seem like you're
using a Mozilla based browser to Google, when in reality, you're still using Qutebrowser.
</p>

<p>
What does this prove?
</p>

<p>
Don't depend on Google for anything. I literally only login to maybe check related
content to see if there's anything else cool within the Linux YouTuber scene these
days to add to my RSS feed list. However, like most based Linux users nowadays,
I mostly just download videos from RSS feeds from Newsboat with 'youtube-dl'
to be later viewed with 'mpv' anyway because streaming videos is a waste of
internet bandwidth, time, energy, and patience.
</p>

<p>
Just in case you're one of those people stuck into the "Oh, but I NEED Google
for things like Gmail, Google Drive" etc, then you need to read these blog posts
and wake up to an improved user experience for better alternatives:
<a href="https://www.kylepiira.com/2020/01/09/why-i-quit-google/">https://www.kylepiira.com/2020/01/09/why-i-quit-google/</a>
</p>

<p>
Also, here are better 'Gmail' alternatives, or even 'Outlook' for that matter
since I despise Microsoft as well:

<p>
I personally have used 'Fastmail' so far, and I like it a lot. However, for good
things come a price, so even though its not free like all of these other email
clients where YOU are the product, it does give me a little peace of mind at least.
The middle tier plan they have is $50 a year, and seems worth it. If not, I'll
probably just host my own email server later on a VPS next year if I don't like it,
but I'll keep it for now:

<p>
Regarding 'searx':
Oh man, what a fail this was too.
</p>

<p>
Why is it that every deployable web app just does NOT work nicely with Ubuntu 20.04? This is the second fail I've had this week since the first was Jitsi Meet which just did not play nicely with Ubuntu 20.04 + Apache running
this site.
</p>

<p>
Now, after a few hours of trying, I just could not get Searx to work at all.
</p>

<p>
It was so frustrating because they changed literally EVERYTHING about their
installation process within a month of Luke Smith's video:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oufXi3e-VuA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oufXi3e-VuA</a>
</p>

<p>
This makes his recent video absolutely useless in comparison. Even though
there are installation scripts, its just mindboggling how nice and easy
the installation process was a month ago via the instructions on screen
on Luke's video vs the current mess that exists:
<a href="http://asciimoo.github.io/searx/admin/installation-searx.html">http://asciimoo.github.io/searx/admin/installation-searx.html</a>
</p>

<p>
I DID however find a guide on how to deploy this on the Raspberry Pi, but this would be for a local instance, and not necessarily a public instance for people in my family unfortunately:
<a href="https://raspiblog.noblogs.org/post/2018/01/27/installing-searx-with-apache-and-morty/">https://raspiblog.noblogs.org/post/2018/01/27/installing-searx-with-apache-and-morty/</a>
</p>

<p>
Let's just say I am not going to be attempting deploying another web app
for family any time soon. I would be more inclined for changing the entire
backend of this website to 'nginx' instead of Apache2, which I aimed
to do at some point anyway, so this is probably just a lesson to never use
Ubuntu as a server basis, and to finally overhaul Apache with 'nginx' instead.
</p>

<p>
The only thing I'd have to recreate is the bare Git repositories I created
earlier, but that can ALWAYS be re-done.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, moving on to more positive things and projects, and will just
label this as another attempt I guess. The best way to learn is to fail, so
I plan on just moving on.

After much deliberating, I was able to kind of get 'transmission' working
on both my local machine and my Raspberry Pi since I wanted to download safe
files like Linux distro ISOs, wallpapers, etc.
</p>

<p>
Think of 'transmission' as one of your typical BitTorrenting clients,
but with a bit more control, and a heck of a lot of less ads and potential
for getting viruses.
</p>

<p>
The reason why you would want to have 'transmission' on a Raspberry Pi device
is that you don't want to waste so much power downloading things like torrents,
images, etc, when you can do it on a low power device to do it all day for you
if needed. The capabilities of this kind of setup are cool because if you hook
up an external HDD to a Raspberry Pi, you can also debate how to make it work
on scraping the internet for data with cool scraper projects.
</p>

<p>
For example, I would love to somehow scrape the "Wayback Machine" for old school
icons, and early internet assets as it brings lovely memories of Yahoo! Geocities
back to mind. Ah yes, back when everyone had their own personal website, although
heavily templated. Looking back, its easy to say that having your own site WAS
the internet, and the direction it took really sucks.
</p>

<p>
Face it, its pretty sad when most people only can think of maybe 5 major sites
that they visit on a daily basis. Back then, you had tons of splintering personal
sites, all for the basis of being able to express yourself freely. Sure the DotCom
bubble was a meme in itself, but I remember all of those weird personal pages that
had highly specific content. Ex: If you searched for old school game art on Yahoo!
back then, you would likely land on some dude's personal website where he hoarded
tons of video game sprite sheets that he somehow collected from using ROM palette
tools. Sure there's tons of community sites that still do this, but it meant more
when a guy's whole personal page was just dedicated to solely that purpose, which
shows the life and soul of the early internet.
</p>

<p>
That makes me want to grab every Pokemon based sprite sheet from late 90's websites
from The Wayback Machine ASAP :), good times.
</p>

<p>
'The Wayback Machine' can be found here, and chances are, your old personal website
or favorite site was archived, so check it out:
<a href="https://web.archive.org/">https://web.archive.org/</a>
</p>

<p>
You can also laugh and see how badly I designed this site over time, but also keep
in mind just how restricted I was in terms of being able to develop this site while
on my lunch break at my first tech job. Geez, I used to have to SSH into a shared
hosted site just to be able to modify this website, but nowadays I just work on this
site locally, and then use 'rsync' to post my changes onto the website that's hosted
by a private VPS.
</p>

<p>
Here's the old past history of 'musimatic.net' for you to enjoy (and wow did I love
a good purple color scheme early on haha):
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2019*/www.musimatic.net">https://web.archive.org/web/2019*/www.musimatic.net</a>
</p>

<p>
Back to the topic of 'transmission':
I tried to make it easy by modifying the 'settings.json' file in the
'/etc/transmission-daemon' directory to accommdate the '~/Downloads' folder.
However, after trying two or three workarounds in this Stack Exchange post, I
gave up:
<a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/221081/permission-denied-when-downloading-with-transmission-daemon">https://askubuntu.com/questions/221081/permission-denied-when-downloading-with-transmission-daemon</a>
</p>

<p>
However, I will work on creating a related symlink that will link to the '<i>var/lib/transmission-daemon/downloads'
directory as 'torrents' or something in my '~</i>' home directory.
</p>

<p>
I believe all I would maybe have to do is just to add the 'sam' user to the
'debian-transmission' group anyway. This is important because for the time being,
in order to access that particular directory, '/var/lib/transmission-daemon/downloads',
I would literally have to use sudo priviledges to do so. This is fine for now, but
might be easier if I just add the user to the 'debian-transmission' group appropriately.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I'm pretty happy it works at least, but let's just say 'transmission' out of the box
is NOT newbie friendly in that respect. However, it is a pretty powerful torrenting tool
that can be run on any lower end PC if needed, which is super cool.
</p>

<p>
'transmission' can be found here, and can be used with CLI or with a GUI;
<a href="https://transmissionbt.com/">https://transmissionbt.com/</a>
</p>

<p>
Also, if you're someone like me who's just looking for legit torrents for nice purposes
like 'wallpapers', Linux ISOs, etc, I found a good blog post for relevant torrent sites in 2020,
which is new to me as I only knew Pirate Bay back in the day like everyone else:
<a href="https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/10-best-torrent-websites/">https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/10-best-torrent-websites/</a>
</p>

<p>
As always, try the CLI version of 'transmission' instead.
</p>

<p>
In Debian distributions, you're gonna need 'transmission-daemon' and 'transmission-remote-cli'
installed, so you're going to want to do the following command in terminal to install the
terminal version of transmission:
</p>

<p>
apt install transmission-daemon transmission-remote-cli
</p>

<p>
After installing the two parts listed above, I would follow along with gotbletu's
YouTube videos on the topic as its not too easy to figure out on your own, so here's
a related playlist to help figure it out:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqv94xWU9zZ05Dbc551z14Eerj2xPWyVt">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqv94xWU9zZ05Dbc551z14Eerj2xPWyVt</a>
</p>

<p>
'gotbletu' shows a lot of bash aliases you can put in your .bashrc config to make using
'transmission' a lot easier too, so I highly recommend checking those out, and any of
his other videos since he's pretty good at just demoing Linux utilities in general.
</p>

<p>
Plus, you can always access your downloads at any time in any browser by going to this
website URL once you have the transmission daemon up and running:
<a href="http://localhost:9091/transmission/web/">http://localhost:9091/transmission/web/</a>
</p>

<p>
One more good thing taken care of this week.
</p>

<p>
Next, I'll attempt adding a private 'Searx' instance. It's a dang shame about how
badly Jitsi Meet doesn't play well with latest Debian or Ubuntu distros though.
However, I learned a lot in attempting to deploy it though. I probably might even
resort to just deploying an IRC based server like 'XMPP' or something:
<a href="https://xmpp.org">https://xmpp.org</a>
</p>

<p>
Also, I'd like to do a few screencasts with gifs using 'screenkey' as well as the
idea of being able to showcase Linux utilities with screencasts is probably the next
best thing I could do to emulate my favorite Inconsolation blog. That and being
able to utilize thumbnails correctly with Emacs Org mode would help as I'd love
to replicate his Wordpress site's ability to just do thumbnails out of the box.
</p>

<p>
Here's 'screenkey' for reference:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/screenkey/screenkey">https://gitlab.com/screenkey/screenkey</a>

<p>
Stay tuned :)

I figured out how to handle images with Emacs Org Mode and related
formatting to make this blog a little more lively with images:
<a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/images-and-xhtml-export.html">https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/images-and-xhtml-export.html</a>

</p>

<p>
I figured out how to use thumbnails with the 'mogrify' command from 'imagemagick'
will become SUPER useful later as I make more and more useful tutorials on this
site with just .org mode sites for specific topics:
<a href="https://imagemagick.org/Usage/thumbnails/">https://imagemagick.org/Usage/thumbnails/</a>
</p>

<p>
Here's the relevant 'mogrify' command:
mogrify -format png -path thumbs/ -thumbnail 100x100 (name of image)
</p>

<p>
For example, I created a thumbnail for later use in the weather portion of
this blog post:
mogrify -format png -path thumbs/ -thumbnail 300x300 weatherCommandScreenshot1.png
</p>

<p>
I also stole this 'Dark Solarize' theme from this GitHub page and used it for my
own blog page as well:
<a href="https://github.com/saccohuo/export-themes/blob/master/org-css/solarized-dark.css">https://github.com/saccohuo/export-themes/blob/master/org-css/solarized-dark.css</a>
</p>

<p>
I also combed through the National Weather Service (NWS)'s Apache server,
and found the following locations to be useful for myself and for
my family's purposes.
</p>

<p>
They're GIF's of the National Weather Service's doppler radar so you
can check if its going to rain or precipitate in your area.
</p>

<p>
This is the NWS's Apache server where you can comb through each of the
'.png' images or gif's present to find out your area:
<a href="https://radar.weather.gov/lite/N0R/">https://radar.weather.gov/lite/N0R/</a>
</p>

<p>
NOTE: I THINK they're based on airport codes, but let's just say I
spent a good amount of time trying to figure out which ones are
relevant, and it wasn't easy since Scranton for example doesn't have
a major airport connected to the National Weather Service, so you
kind of have to look at the doppler for a nearby city instead.
</p>

<p>
Here's some useful weather doppler gifs I plan on re-hosting on this
site at a later point with a CRON job on a related "Weather" tab
on the site for family to use:

In terms of re-designing this blog portion of the site, I plan on
re-designing this blog portion of my site with the Org-Mode based themes
from this guy's GitHub as I REALLY like the "ReadTheDocs" theme he's got:
<a href="https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes">https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes</a>
</p>

<p>
Before I used to use the "Ox-TWBS" plugin for Emacs to export this blog into
a Twitter Bootstrap CSS styled site. However, after moving into Doom Emacs,
I realized I should play around with the default styling a bit for this blog,
so I plan on exploring this a bit further.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of re-design, I STILL need to fix those the "Images" section on this
site as I think its just a matter of not having the correct permissions to allow
a user to view my old artwork.
</p>

<p>
I'm in the process of wiping my desktop drive so I can install Devuan
on it, and just test out Linux distros in VM's to find some cool setups
with some Window Managers. It's more so that I can possibly move to an Arch
based distro without systemd sometime later this year, but didn't want to blow
up the desktop computer itself like my last attempt with just an Arch install
with Steam.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of Steam and 'muh games', I plan on really only buying games for my
Nintendo Switch and to keep computers as just that. I think Desktops are cool
for making music or possibly to aid in emulating older games, but past that, playing games
on a Desktop computer is a bit of a waste of time. I'd rather be building some cool
stuff with that same time.
</p>

<p>
Also, I'm kind of tired of playing a game on a console, I know when to put it down.
However, when I had the latter on Steam, I could quickly forget the time, and
kind of regret it later. Anyway, the cryptocurrency bros ruined the PC market anyway,
so there's no point in building high end machines unless you plan on running VM's.
Even for that use case scenario, you don't even need a top tier video card as well.
You would just need to make sure you have a decent CPU and RAM. I do plan on
getting a librebooted computer though, so I'm not sure how long my wanting to
do VM's on a regular basis will last in that case.
</p>

<p>
These things I wish I knew before, but at least I have an ok Desktop computer for
today's standards to just run VM's on, and to later become a cool media server or
something. I've been using it for emulators and have been having a good time with it.
I plan on making some demos with Audacity, and then remaster tracks within Reaper
with MIDI for that newer band I'm going to create called "Sieges", which will be
a Dungeon Synth band. I'm still debating if I should just release it on the Bandcamp
platform, or just host it on my own site, with a custom CSS style sheet to mimic Bandcamp
since all I would have to do is to just allow people to hit play in some kind of web
based music player. I wouldn't charge for the music either, and will most likely do
donation incentives through Patreon or something similar.
</p>

<p>
I also kind of debate making Linux tutorial type videos for sites like Library or BitChute,
and not necessarily YouTube since YouTube is just become more and more censored as
the years go on. I'd rather be on a platform where I'm welcome than be banned for
being conservative or something. However, I might take up Luke Smith's philosophy
to maybe just use YouTube until you get banned just to piss them off or something
for being on their platform regardless as its still sort of the world's marketplace
in the truest sense at the moment.
</p>

<p>
I'm gonna try deploying Searx sometime later today as a private instance so that
should be fun as well. Feels good to put the power back into my hands, and to
take back all of that free telemetry ad money from Google and DuckDuckGo.
</p>

<p>
Also, I plan on ripping this CD I got the other week since I couldn't find it on
Bandcamp or Spotify anymore (though I don't use Spotify at all, it used to only
be available on there for a long time):
<a href="https://www.discogs.com/sell/release/9525344?ev=rb">https://www.discogs.com/sell/release/9525344?ev=rb</a>

Probably the most funniest, down to earth album you will ever hear in your life.

I tried to install Jitsi Meet but failed because of these two dumb
issues that still haven't been resolved by the Jitsi team:
</p>

<p>
Related GitHub issue on the same topic:
<a href="https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/6371">https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/6371</a>
</p>

<p>
Duplicate issue where they're still working on this issue:
<a href="https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/pull/6627">https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/pull/6627</a>
</p>

<p>
Basically, in a nutshell, they're using "Certbot-Auto", which has
been deprecated for releases like Ubuntu 20.04.
</p>

<p>
This means that unless they patch this into the installation shell
scripts, I would manually have to apply a workaround using 'certbot' to
install the appropriate certificate, and manually configure a lot of the
files present to get it to run. I don't feel comfortable doing that so,
I just nuked the Jitsi Meet private instance I created.
</p>

<p>
On the flip side, I plan on deploying a private Searx instance, so that
I never have to use Google or DuckDuckGo again myself, so that'll be fun.
</p>

<p>
This time though, I'll read through the whole documentation to make sure
that Searx is cool with Ubuntu 20.04.
</p>

<p>
'searx' can be found here, and you can actively use some public instances of it,
though its more recommended to host your own instance to make sure its as secure
as possible since YOU control it in that case:

On a good note, I was able to install Doom Emacs just fine, and I have gotta say,
it looks, feels, and just responds amazingly. I know other Emacs enthusiasts would
just say "its someone else's config" but I've been using Vanilla Emacs for quite
a bit, and there's just so much that should have been added right out of the box
as a default like this.
</p>

<p>
So it goes without saying, I'm back to using Vim style bindings, and I'm pretty
happy about it. I still know Emacs style bindings for other shell programs wherever
needed, but let's all agree Vim bindings are 100x better and more intuitive.
Those who think they've memorized every C-c or C-o style binding in Emacs is
insane, or is straight up lying. Some are intuitive for starters but when you
delve into Org-mode with vanilla Emacs bindings, then you realize its almost impossible
for a normal person to remember half of the bindings anyway.

I got up to Chapter 5 for that C Programming Language book today.
</p>

<p>
C is such a cool language, and the power of it can't be overstated. 
It is embedded in so many devices to the point where if you can 
program in C, you can pretty much use it to program on anything 
(that isn't requiring pure assembly language of course :D).
</p>

<p>
I'm debating what the best things I can do to install on the work
based Devuan VM I have so far. I'd like to maybe consider using 
something like "exwm" which is basically Emacs as a window manager,
which is such a neat concept. The idea is that everything would be
Emacs based by default. This would be cool because then you can
basically run Doom Emacs as well for text editing so that you can
use the glorious Vim bindings, but use the pretty decent Emacs 
standard bindings for other things as well.
</p>

<p>
Just an fyi, Doom Emacs doesn't have any evil connotation. It's 
named that way because it adds 'evil' mode style bindings (hence
'vi' in 'evil') which allow you to use 'Vi' or 'Vim' style key
bindings within Emacs. Personally, I think Vim's bindings are far
superior than Emacs. I love being able to write this blog with
Emacs alongside the 'org-twbs' export plugin with standard Emacs
keybindings. However, past using Emacs keybindings in Org Mode to
write documents, I think they're pretty terrible for actual coding
situations. More or less, they're very very very hard to remember
and way less intuitive than Vim's default bindings.
</p>

<p>
However, for those that totally complain about Emacs keybindings
as being 'painful' probably don't realize that you can totally 
use your left thumb for the 'meta' or 'alt' key based bindings,
and also use the right ring finger for the 'p' key. Too many times
I see the term, "Emacs pinkie", being used, and I just have to laugh
since most likely the person is attemping to use the 'p' key with
their pinkie, when the right ring finger is almost near the same
position anyway.
</p>

<p>
Just to set the record straight, I like Emacs bindings for Org Mode
and some terminal related applications that happen to have them,
but I prefer Vim bindings for any coding situations (hence Doom
Macs is probably what I should be using going forward).

I've installed DietPi on the Raspberry Pi, and just plan to use
it as a downloading agent. I might get a separate external drive
for it to store media so that I can use it to scrape the net
for content, and then later access it afterwards purely through
SFTP or ssh to retrieve the data from it. That alone is such a cool
idea because if you booted your huge desktop computer just to do
menial tasks such as downloading wallpapers, then its a bit of 
a waste of energy.
</p>

<p>
I'm thinking of the possibilities of what I could do to either 
deploy Jitsi or Jami as a private instance for family communication
 purposes. I find both pretty fascinating as they can be used on 
most platforms AND they are secure communication programs.
</p>

I also wonder what can be done with mesh networks such as 
'gnunet'. The idea of being able to link computers and devices
together without depending upon a centralized internet service
company sounds amazing. This idea alone could be used for sharing
files, communication, etc, even when a grid is potentially knocked
down. Sounds pretty useful given the times.
</p>

<p>
'gnunet' can be found here:
<a href="https://gnunet.org/en/">https://gnunet.org/en/</a>

<p>
I'm planning on also figuring out what to do next week since I
have it off from work. Most likely, I might go ahead and start
that one-man dungeon synth band, "Sieges", as I've been planning
in my head forever. That band will probably include loops, drum 
samples, and keyboard riffs. I'd like it to be the anti-thesis of what 
you can typically find in this genre under Bandcamp, as I would
like to prove that you can create some cool themed music in that
genre without having it to be so dark or dreary. As seen by a few
select bands in that genre, I think the best encompassing idea of
that genre is to utilize RPG video game style music but with relaxing
themes. However, I think a lot of those great ideas are kind of lost 
between the all too many dreary dark albums of that genre on Bandcamp, 
so here's to proving that positive dungeon synth music can be made.
</p>

<p>
Never stop learning, and have fun with Linux :) God Bless.

Thanks to my dude, Luke Smith, I was able to finally get all 
my Git repositories back on my site with his latest video:
<a href="https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=ju9loeXNVW0">https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=ju9loeXNVW0</a>
</p>

<p>
If you've never used "www.invidio.us" before, then you probably
should, as it allows you to check out YouTube videos in terminal
based browsers like 'w3m' easily.
</p>

<p>
If you attempt to use vanilla YouTube's site in 'w3m', Google complains
about the lack of the JS scripts that are not present because 'w3m'
runs purely based on HTML alone, so they can't track you nor give
you targeted ads.
</p>

<p>
Here's w3m for reference, as it is an awesome browser I use every day:
<a href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/">http://w3m.sourceforge.net/</a>
</p>

<p>
With this in mind, I'll have to wait until Luke's next Git video to
finish off my bare Git repos, but I'm glad to say I have killed any notion of
having to depend on Microsoft for GitHub since all I ever wanted
was bare Git repositories anyway for my projects.
</p>

<p>
Other than that, still learning C, and dived slightly into 
'ncurses' with the one guide I got from Internet Archive.
</p>

<p>
Pretty cool stuff, and compared to the C programming book,
'ncurses' is pretty light in terms of the difficulty in figuring
it out.
</p>

<p>
I plan on making a 'ncurses' program to move over my dotfiles,
and will host it on my Git instance when I flesh out the beginnings
of it so that anyone can pull it down.
</p>

<p>
I've been playing around with the idea of using a Linux VM purely 
for work, and just remoting in with a terminal based app for Slack, 
and just use WINE to emulate the Windows based programs I help do 
tech support for on a daily basis.
</p>

<p>
That thought alone is pretty based, and I'd still be playing by
the rules for work as I'd be running a VM inside of Windows so that
I could still get security updates to make work's IT team happy,
but also keep myself motivated as my workflow would most likely
increase 100% if I could just do everything with Emacs or Vim bindings :)
</p>

<p>
Also, I made further progress on creating the all-in-one ElectronJS
based app for work. Though I've detested just  how bloated web apps 
are, in this context, ElectronJS would allow me to create a GUI based 
app for my coworkers to make their workflow better, and their daily 
life doing ticket work easier. That alone is a cool motivator keeping 
me going these days in terms of working since the days have kind of 
been blending for months now.
</p>

<p>
I'm looking forward to the Florida move in a month since it'll
be good to get away from a city center amidst all this crazy stuff
going on.
</p>

<p>
Staying positive, and thankful that I can look forward to better
things. On the flip side though, Nashville was so awesome. Its a 
shame, since I really saw myself trying to start a family out here
before all this crazy stuff this year. 
</p>

<p>
The food, people, and music were 100x better than anything I've 
experienced in the NY tri-state area. I'll definitely miss this place
but I'm glad to have at least tried it out. However, I doubt live
music will ever recover, so I guess its time to leave 'Music City'
for good.
</p>

<p>
God help us all in these times, and stay safe. God Bless.

<h2 id="org2c7cdf9">June 18, 2020</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2c7cdf9">
<p>
Learned three cool things this week regarding Linux.
</p>

<p>
First Thing:
</p>

<p>
This is Linux file permissions in a nutshell from what I learned: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You first have '-' which is a file, or 'd' for a directory.</li>
<li>Past that, you've got three groups: You, your group, and everyone else who can execute scripts on the machine.</li>
<li>The options include 'r' for read, 'w' for write, and 'x' for execute.</li>
<li>r: 4, w: 2, x: 1</li>
</ul>

<p>
And that's basically it.
</p>

<p>
This helps a ton when you're trying to figure out what in the heck
'777' means in terms of file permissions or '755'.
</p>

<p>
You have to break down each part of the number provided.
</p>

<p>
Ex: '777' in file permissions means the following:
You've got read ('r'), write ('w'), and execute ('x') access in 
ALL three groups. This means that YOU, YOUR GROUP, AND EVERYONE
ELSE can do those three actions on the file.
</p>

<p>
This isn't the best option because you don't want someone to somehow
hack into your system and just give them permission to files without
even being granted access as the root user.
</p>

<p>
Second Thing:
</p>

<p>
This is how you can utilize the 'Newsboat' RSS program across 
several devices (aka your Android phone running Termux, your website via
SSH, your Linux laptop, your Linux desktop, etc).
</p>

<p>
You can utilize Newsboat's '-e' parameter to export your current news
feed into an .opml file.
</p>

<p>
You can also utilize Newsboat's 'E' parameter to export a copy of the
list of articles you read.
</p>

<p>
You can then go to a totally separate machine, and utilize Newsboat's 
'-i' parameter to import your newsfeed.
</p>

<p>
Then you can use Newsboat's '-I' parameter to import the list of
articles you already read on your previous devices.
</p>

<p>
In this kind of scenario, it's better to use your personal website
as a midway station so that if you have access to the internet,
then you can technically just sync all these devices by using 'wget'
to pull down these two files from your 'public<sub>html</sub>' folder.
</p>

<p>
You can even do the same thing with a separate device off the internet
with a Raspberry Pi or even an Android device with Termux that has
a mobile connection or is connected to WiFi.
</p>

<p>
Here's my latest Bash alias from my .bashrc config that incorporates these ideas,
which I will probably modify to run on my website instead later on but is given
as a cool example to possibly copy:
alias ne="newsboat &amp;&amp;  newsboat -e &gt;&gt; ~/transformationStation/newsboat/currentNewsboatFeed.opml &amp;&amp; newsboat -E ~/transformationStation/newsboat/articlesRead.txt"
</p>

<p>
Third Thing:
</p>

<p>
Here's a cool Bash function I made to  change your wallpaper and color
scheme with 'feh' and 'pywal'. 
</p>

<p>
Afterwards, it copies the same image that was used by 'pywal' into Awesome 
Window Manager's theme configuration directory:
</p>

<p>
ranchw() {
    wal -i ~/Pictures/wallpapers/ &amp;&amp; feh &#x2013;bg-fill "\((< "\){HOME}/.cache/wal/wal")" &amp;&amp; cp $(&lt; ~/.cache/wal/wal) ~/.config/awesome/themes/multicolor/wall.png &amp;&amp; xrdb ~/.Xresources;
</p>

<p>
background=\((ex -sc '/\*background:/s/^\S\+\s\+//p|q!' ~/.cache/wal/colors.Xresources);
    foreground=\)(ex -sc '<i>\*foreground:/s/^&sect;\+\s\+//p|q!' ~</i>.cache/wal/colors.Xresources);
</p>

<p>
ex -c '<i>theme.bg<sub>normal</sub>/s</i>"[^"]\+"<i>"'$background'"/|wq' ~</i>.config/awesome/themes/multicolor/theme.lua;
</p>

<p>
ex -c '<i>theme.fg<sub>normal</sub>/s</i>"[^"]\+"<i>"'$foreground'"/|wq' ~</i>.config/awesome/themes/multicolor/theme.lua;
</p>

<p>
}

I was able to get sound working on my Devuan desktop, but let's just
say Nvidia drivers are a pain to attempt to get running if you want
to limit what's installed via 'pins' in the following directory:
/etc/apt/preferences.d
</p>

<p>
This is important since I'd like to update my video card drivers
to use game console emulators effectively, since the performance
out of the box was pretty bad, which is weird since that desktop
was an older gaming rig anyway, and I'm just using it for emulation
and POSSIBLY music creation.
</p>

<p>
Might create a dungeon synth band with the moniker, "Sieges", since
I've been wanting to do instrumental synth music, but be the
absolutle anti-thesis of what they'd expect on Bandcamp since a lot
of solo acts in that genre is pretty dark, when I'd rather it be a 
little more light-hearted and cheerful. That fact alone is kind of 
weird when a lot of people making dungeon synth albums are just
ripping off game music ideas in the first place, so why the negativity?
Who knows.
</p>

<p>
I've been learning C, and got to the third chapter of the 
"The C Programming Language (Second Edition)" book from the 80's.
Neat stuff, though thank God I have the answers for the exercises
as I am treating it more as a code along to learn enough C to pickup
'ncurses' based programs.
</p>

<p>
I might dive into trying to figure out Mutt with the manual this week.
</p>

<p>
I might also simultaneously go through the one 'ncurses' guide on
how to make 'ncurses' based programs in C as well.
</p>

<p>
I would also like to figure out how to make a few hooks with 'Dired'
mode in Emacs for my Org Mode TODO list for work. Moreso, I should
just archive them into a giant directory and use the archive feature,
or at least create a hook that would do the following items for me:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Create tomorrow's directory in the directory above</li>
<li>Copy over the contents of the current Todo List into tomorrow's</li>
</ol>
<p>
Todo List.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Change the date at the top of the Todo List accordingly.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Also, I'd like to possibly change over the theme styling of this page
using the "org-twbs-head" function:
<a href="https://github.com/marsmining/ox-twbs/blob/d5ae9c3fb224d081d59d3686d619edf152523f09/ox-twbs.el#L987-L1002">https://github.com/marsmining/ox-twbs/blob/d5ae9c3fb224d081d59d3686d619edf152523f09/ox-twbs.el#L987-L1002</a>

Have fun for the rest of the week, stay safe :).

<h2 id="orgb14cf3f">June 11, 2020</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb14cf3f">
<p>
Minor point I learned the other night is to be able to pipe the 'pwd'
command into the 'xsel' command.
</p>

<p>
This allows you to pipe the 'working directory' that you obtain with
'pwd' command into 'xsel' which copies your working directory onto
your clipboard.
</p>

<p>
This allows you to be able to paste your working directory into another
terminal pane in a multiplexer like tmux so that you can work on a 
similar task in the same directory.
</p>

<p>
Give this a try in a Linux terminal:
pwd | xsel
</p>

<p>
You can also convert this to an 'alias' in your Bash terminal by
using the following in your .bashrc config file ('pwc' in this
context stands for 'print working copy'):
alias pwc="pwd | xsel"
</p>

<p>
Oh, and I figured out how to finally do transparency in the terminal
with urxvt terminal.
</p>

<p>
It turns out, you have to modify your .Xresources file to include the
following:
</p>

<p>
! Transparency for urxvt:
URxvt.depth: 32
URxvt.transparent: true
URxvt.tintColor: white
! Set .shading to: 20 for slight transparency
! Set .shading to: 40 for fuller transparency
URxvt.shading: 30
</p>

<p>
Here's what a glorious transparent terminal looks like (screenshots):

<a href="images/transparentNewsboatScreenshot.png">Transparent Newsboat Screenshot</a>

I took the advice on how to adjust my .Xresources file accordingly 
from this link, so all creds to the answer to the OP on this Arch

I installed Devuan on my Desktop computer yesterday with Openbox, and
I must say, its a pretty comfy experience.
</p>

<p>
I was trying to get some game emulators working, but sound isn't 
working on the Scarlett Solo audio interface I have.
</p>

<p>
I got sound to work in the past, but maybe its an issue with alsa.
I'm also thinking that I probably might have given up and installed
Pulseaudio as a result.
</p>

<p>
Will keep researching that another time but I'm making it a mission
to not give up and install Pulseaudio since I'd prefer just straight
Alsa audio instead.
</p>

<p>
Openbox on the same note is a really cool and great lightweight
window manager:
<a href="http://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page">http://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page</a>
</p>

<p>
The idea is that if you like Windoze, just use Openbox on a Linux
distribution, and kiss Microsoft goodbye. Openbox offers the same 
type of window experience in terms of dragging windows around manually.
</p>

<p>
Plus you can customize the window themes, and config files easily as well,
so there's really no reason to keep Windoze, other than maybe for
"muh games". Even that reason is dumb given that Steam Proton is
getting pretty good for keeping up with Steam games.
</p>

<p>
More and more, if I wanted to play games, I'd prefer just emulating
things, and would rather even get PC centered ports on Switch if
I really wanted to play any new gen games.
</p>

<p>
Games in general are fun from time to time, but PC gaming as an
industry and as a hardware market have really gone downhill in
my opinion on a lot of factors.
</p>

<p>
Why keep up with hardware cost constraints when you've got
cryptocurrency miners just completely ruining the hardware market
in terms of video card costs. If you've ever shopped for a somewhat
OK video card, you'll see how ridiculous its become. Now its to 
the point where you should just build an OK desktop, run Linux on it,
or even just get an old Thinkpad to run some minimial Linux distro on it.
Better yet, even take an old computer, run some stable Debian based
minimal distribution (without Systemd :)) and you're golden.
</p>

<p>
Either way, pretty happy at the moment as I've conquered a few tasks
this year so far that were really bothering me which included getting rid 
of my GitHub, and getting a FastMail email account to move away from evil
proprietary Microsoft Outlook.
</p>

<p>
Richard Stallman was right in that if the product is free (MS Outlook), 
YOU are the product. So, why give Microsoft free money from the
obvious telemetry that they're doing on my account when I could
just be on a more secure and freer platform. I'll try out FastMail
for a year, and if it sucks, I'll find a different solution (or
maybe host my own on a VPS instead).
</p>

<p>
Looking forward to possibly improving the design of this site's images
section, maybe the styling on this Blog portion of the site with a 
sample Bootstrap theme by modifying the "org-twbs-export-to-html" function's
"org-twbs-head" function:
<a href="https://github.com/marsmining/ox-twbs/blob/d5ae9c3fb224d081d59d3686d619edf152523f09/ox-twbs.el#L987-L1002">https://github.com/marsmining/ox-twbs/blob/d5ae9c3fb224d081d59d3686d619edf152523f09/ox-twbs.el#L987-L1002</a>
</p>

<p>
On another note, for better work productivity, I figured out how to rip 
a current ZenDesk ticket tab's information so that I can copy the
entire ticket information into a ZenDesk TODO list item onto my clipboard.
</p>

<p>
I'm trying to figure out how to use the "GreaseMonkey" extension so
that I can just run this on the fly as well, so that's been a new good
challenge for work.
</p>

<p>
Other than that, I've been learning more C from the related second edition
of the book, "The C Programming Language". C is definitely interesting,
and I can see portions of it were used for Python as some of the syntax
carries over.
</p>

<p>
I'll be interested in what projects I can create with C later on, but
I'm positive that the possibilities are really endless as C is basically
on most platforms anyway. Combined with the 'ncurses' interface library,
I'll be making terminal apps in no time, so I'm curious on how far I'll
be able to create some pet project C based apps this year.
</p>

<p>
I'm debating using either Neomutt in tmux for terminal based e-mail or
give into using Emacs based email with 'mu4e'. Both options are cool
but have their advantages and disadvantages. Mostly, both routes are
pretty hard, but I'm leaning towards Neomutt, as I've liked using it
before using Luke Smith's "Mutt Wizard" scripts. However, the last
time I used his installation scripts, the GPG keys weren't working
correctly.
</p>

<p>
Basically, terminal based email involves the following items as far as
what I've researched:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sync based utility to sync mail with IMAP</li>
<li>Utility to send mail via SMTP protocol</li>
<li>Utility to encrypt emails with GPG keys</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm definitely curious on how to do this process myself, but know that
it will probably take a good majority of a weekend day to figure it out
to get it up and running based on the Neomutt manual alone or something.
</p>

<p>
We'll see what I pick soon I guess :)
</p>

<p>
Stay safe, God Bless.

I completely removed my GitHub account as I want nothing to do with
Microsoft going forward.
</p>

<p>
I think GitHub isn't that great of a service and feel that I do better
off with hosting my own projects as just .git directories on my own
web page.
</p>

<p>
If anyone is really that interested in obtaining a repo for their own
use, then they could just 'wget' the contents of the page and be done
with it.
</p>

<p>
Pretty happy about this move though.
</p>

<p>
Now I just have to move all of my personal project repos to their
own git instances on the public facing portion of my website, and 
we'll be good.

<p>
One step closer without any dependence upon Microsoft. Today is a
good day.

I re-did my Linux laptop with Devuan instead of Debian min installer.
</p>

<p>
It went well except I had to follow this post to fix the sound issue
present with alsamixer:
<a href="https://dev.to/setevoy/linux-alsa-lib-pcmdmixc1108sndpcmdmixopen-unable-to-open-slave-38on">https://dev.to/setevoy/linux-alsa-lib-pcmdmixc1108sndpcmdmixopen-unable-to-open-slave-38on</a>
</p>

<p>
Basically, I just had to add a "default.conf" file in the <i>etc/modprobe.d</i> directory.
</p>

<p>
Devuan is basically Debian without 'systemd'. 'systemd' is pretty 
controversial as it is an init system that could be potentially used
as a backdoor.
</p>

<p>
I'd say as long as I have the freedom to install whatever I want on my
computer, I'd rather opt out of systemd completely, so I did.
</p>

<p>
Devuan can be found here:
<a href="https://devuan.org/">https://devuan.org/</a>
</p>

<p>
It was just as easy to install as Debian minimal stable net installer,
so I highly recommend it the sound issue was the only issue I've had so
far, but easily fixed it with the forum post link above.
</p>

<p>
The only other major issue was the pain of having to create a new SSH
key by hand since DigitalOcean's dumb website didn't work nicely with
Qutebrowser (most likely because they have a ton of ad-trackers that
were blocked by default with Qutebrowser). Might pick a different
VPS with an easier website later on as a result if I can find one.
Let's just say I don't want to have to literally type in an SSH key
by hand ever again any time soon to just re-gain SSH access to my
site.
</p>

<p>
Next, I'd like to then look into buying a used Thinkpad X60 or X200 
laptop to do a software based libreboot so I don't have to solder a 
Raspberry Pi onto the laptop itself to remove the proprietary BIOS from 
it.
</p>

<p>
However, it looks like people on eBay know what they're selling so
I'll have to keep my eye out for a good deal. Might even have to get
one without a hard drive, but this is fine since I'm ok with even
HDD's as I think SSD's are kind of just ok to be honest.
</p>

<p>
In terms of learning Linux based utilities, I want to definitely 
take a look a learning the "coreutils" found here:
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/faq/coreutils-faq.html">https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/faq/coreutils-faq.html</a>
</p>

<p>
Along with core utils, learning C has been cool, and Bash looks 
like its gonna be fun to learn. Definitely want to check out
the 'ncurses' library as well for good ideas of terminal apps
to make.
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure what I'm going to do with my desktop machine. 
</p>

<p>
I'm debating to just nuke the Arch installation since that ALSO
has 'systemd'. If anything, Steam probably has a ton of telemetry
anyway, and those games aren't really that essential anyway.
</p>

<p>
It would better to just run emulators if I want to run games anyway,
however I might change my mind to just keep a games based drive
anyway. Might just do Manjaro without 'systemd' for the games based
based SSD drive instead.
</p>

<p>
Here's a list of things I'd like to get done sometime in the next
few weeks:

<p>
On another note, I've been going through 2 Samuel in terms of bible
reading, and have learned a lot. Let's just say people in biblical
times have had more difficult decisions to make, so it puts any
of the dumb stresses of modern life into perspective and makes them
kind of laughably meaningless in a good way.
</p>

<p>
Keeping positive despite the times, and am still having a blast
learning Linux based stuff along the way.
</p>

<p>
Hoping for a good house setup later with a homestead to match, but
one day at a time.

After much deliberation, I was finally able to get "youtube-dl" to 
work with Udemy.
</p>

<p>
Udemy is basically a site where you can take online video courses.
</p>

<p>
I combined a few ideas but here's what you have to do to download
Udemy videos using 'cookie extractor' and 'youtube-dl':
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You have to first provide a web browser cookie that contains your previous login information.</li>
</ol>
<p>
This means that you'll have to literally use a web browser of your choice, login to the Udemy website, and close out of the browser.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li value="2">You'll then need to use a cookie extractor to finish the job.</li>
</ol>

<p>
I used this one to manually do the job: <a href="https://github.com/jdallien/cookie_extractor">https://github.com/jdallien/cookie_extractor</a> 
</p>

<p>
There are web extensions for other browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox as well if needed that do the same thing.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li value="3">Once 'cookie extractor' is installed successfully, you then have to point cookie extractor to the correct location.</li>
</ol>

<p>
I've been using 'qutebrowser' as my web browser, so my cookies are located in my home directory: 
~/.local/share/qutebrowser/webengine/Cookies 
</p>

<p>
This is the command I ran to export the 'cookies.txt' file successfully, and save it to the ~/Downloads directory: 
cookieextractor ~/.local/share/qutebrowser/webengine/Cookies &gt; ~/Downloads/cookies.txt
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li value="4">Then, read this 'youtube-dl' GitHub issue for more information as there's a pretty good guide in the 'Valid Cookie File':</li>
</ol>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/4539">https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/4539</a>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li value="5">Here's an example command you need to provide to youtube-dl that</li>
</ol>
<p>
I personally used to obtain the .mp4 video of the lecture I was on,
which discussed 'Heroku' which is basically a way to host your own
apps in a cloud environment:
</p>

<p>
youtube-dl <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp">https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp</a> &#x2013;cookies ~/Downloads/cookies.txt &#x2013;playlist-items "184" -o '%(playlist)s/%(chapter<sub>number</sub>)s. %(chapter)s/%(playlist<sub>index</sub>)s. %(title)s.%(ext)s'
</p>

<p>
And there you have it.
</p>

<p>
I can finally watch course videos on my own time without the need
of streaming video players for online Udemy courses I already
paid for.
</p>

<p>
Why waste the bandwidth, when you can just download it once, and
never deal with buffering videos again?
</p>

<p>
'youtube-dl' rules, and this proves it.
</p>

<p>
Will keep learning 'mpv' and other related tools to make some cool
scripts to share. Stay tuned.
</p>

<p>
God Bless.

I finally got AwesomeWM to display terminal windows with gaps, with
the help of this example AwesomeWM config I found:
<a href="https://pastebin.com/yTHUmDeL">https://pastebin.com/yTHUmDeL</a>
</p>

<p>
This is mentioned in the Arch Wiki, however, its not too clear where
exactly the "Theme" section begins:
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Awesome">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Awesome</a>
</p>

<p>
Here's a screenshot to show the "beautiful.useless<sub>gap</sub> = 5" setting
(which I was able to do via Emacs with C-u C-c C-l):
</p>

<div id="org2c8c1ea" class="figure">
<p><img src="images/May2020ScreenshotAwesomeWM.png" alt="May2020ScreenshotAwesomeWM.png" width="700" style="border:2px solid black;" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
This is good since I was pretty dang close to just finding a new 
window manager if I couldn't figure out gaps easily.
</p>

<p>
However, the more I learned about 'systemd', the more I realized
I need to get all Linux computers switched to distros without it
for optimization reasons.
</p>

<p>
With this in mind, I'm debating Gentoo:
<a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">https://www.gentoo.org/</a>
</p>

<p>
vs Slackware:
<a href="http://www.slackware.com/">http://www.slackware.com/</a>
</p>

<p>
vs Devuan:
<a href="https://devuan.org/">https://devuan.org/</a>
</p>

<p>
I'm also debating getting a backup laptop, specifically one that 
can be "librebooted".
</p>

<p>
The 'Devuan' operating system listed above flat out is totally
against 'systemd' which is awesome, and their reasoning can be
found here:
<a href="https://devuan.org/os/init-freedom">https://devuan.org/os/init-freedom</a>
</p>

<p>
The reason is that if you libreboot a Linux computer, you're able to
bypass the default Intel based BIOS that could be spying on you.
</p>

<p>
Though, normal users like myself don't have anything to hide, that
thought alone is kind of dumb to not at least put the power back
into your own hands. Its just better for peace of mind to just use
free and open software overall.
</p>

<p>
Best quote on this topic is from Richard Stallman himself:
"To be able to choose between proprietary software packages is to be
able to choose your master. Freedom means not having a master."
</p>

<p>
Richard Stallman's computer habits on his Thinkpad T400s can be 
found here:
<a href="https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html">https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html</a>
</p>

<p>
Of course, though Internet Service Providers are likely to do the 
same dang thing anyway, I would still like the ability to run 
FOSS (free as in freedom) software in whatever manner I'd like to,
and not on the terms of a Linux distribution like Debian that forces
'systemd' on its users.
</p>

<p>
Makes me want to get a Thinkpad T400s off eBay to libreboot.
</p>

<p>
A great resource for this topic for anyone considering to throw
their Windows infested computers into the trash, and librebooting it
with GNU/Linux is this site I found:
<a href="https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/ThinkWiki">https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/ThinkWiki</a>
</p>

<p>
I do however like Debian a lot for its stability so 'Deuvan' seems
like the best choice as its basically a fork of Debian without 'systemd'.
</p>

<p>
In terms of the last week off due to vacation, I'm glad to have been 
able to complete a lot of things last week in terms of minor things for 
my Linux laptop.
</p>

<p>
With that in mind, I plan on just skimming the rest of that course, and
finish up the one JS based book to kind of finish my learning stuff for work.
</p>

<p>
After that, I plan on somehow optimizing my actual job's workflow for Emacs 
in Windows (or figure out how to dual boot the work computer with Linux 
and run Windoze as a Virtual Machine :D).
</p>

<p>
This debate of deciding what is the best OS to pick has kept my mind off the
crazier and crazier world we are now living in.
</p>

<p>
But most of all, I trust in God's Will, since I would like to also get into 
homesteading one day as well, and need favor on the next couple of decisions
for my life.
</p>

<p>
Looking forward to another month to kick butt at work, and yet another week off
at the end of it :).
</p>

<p>
Stay safe, and God Bless.

I was able to install 'pywal' with pip3, which basically allows you
to change terminal color schemes on the fly.
</p>

<p>
Here is the link to 'pywal' on GitHub:
<a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal">https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal</a>
</p>

<p>
However, it wasn't necessarily changing my wallpaper as well, so
I created a function within my .bashrc config file to change both
the color scheme via the 'wal' command AND the wallpaper via 
'nitrogen' command:
</p>

<p>
This can be found in the "# 'pywal' based adjustment" section of my .bashrc:
<a href="https://github.com/SBanya/dotfiles/tree/master/bash">https://github.com/SBanya/dotfiles/tree/master/bash</a>
</p>

<p>
The result is a bit of a workaround. However, it was pretty neat since it
taught me how to obtain the default user input with the "$1" argument.
</p>

<p>
I'm thinking of ways to maybe incorporate this same idea to possibly
give me a color scheme for my "AwesomeWM" (Awesome Window Manager) as
well.
</p>

<p>
Also, I want to learn how to use AwesomeWM with gaps as well.
</p>

<p>
If I can't get that to work, I might even jump ship and try a completely
different window manager.
</p>

<p>
On another note, the dang Arch drive is having issues powering off again
since it just shows a blinking "_" cursor upon logging off from AwesomeWM
on the desktop machine.
</p>

<p>
This most likely is an issue with the video card driver, or the lack of
updates.
</p>

<p>
If I can't really fix it&#x2026; well, I might just give up and try Slackware
instead on the remaining partition, and just re-do the Arch install with
Gentoo later on since its been just a dumb uphill battle to get Arch
to boot. Using Arch so far on that machine has been a battle of "Will
this system actually boot without errors today?".
</p>

<p>
Maybe I should just use something Debian based but with access to Arch
repositories. Who knows.
</p>

<p>
I'm still glad to have figured out 'pywal' though, cause its so neat.

<li>Allow user to search for email in mailboxes OTHER than their</li>

<p>
'INBOX' folder. Users like myself have heavily filtered folders for
their Outlook email, so it would make sense to allow them to select

I'm in the process of relaxing for a bit as I have the week off due to
the buildup of one comp day, and I'm piggybacking off Memorial Day 
weekend.
</p>

<p>
As such, I have had a bit of time to really adjust my aliases for
my .bashrc to allow to for quick two letter commands to open up
programs easily in two seconds in Bash terminal, which is pretty cool.
</p>

<p>
Latest changes to my .bashrc file can be found here:
<a href="https://github.com/SBanya/dotfiles/blob/master/bash/.bashrc">https://github.com/SBanya/dotfiles/blob/master/bash/.bashrc</a>
</p>

<p>
I also am in the process of swapping out internet browsers to check
out IceCat, and then maybe just settle for Qutebrowser instead as well.
</p>

<p>
As such, I created a parser Python 3 based script that basically takes
the "bookmarks.html" file that you can export from Mozilla Firefox
and just rips out the "href" attribute into a resulting "links.txt" file
so that you can import it into other browsers like "Qutebrowser" or
utilities such as "DMenu".
</p>

<p>
This project can be found here on my GitHub page:
<a href="https://github.com/SBanya/MozillaFirefoxBookmarkParser">https://github.com/SBanya/MozillaFirefoxBookmarkParser</a>
</p>

<p>
On the topic of GitHub, I've realized that I can simply host a public
facing .git instance, so I might actually just move all my projects
to this website's public<sub>html</sub> folder, and just nuke my entire 
GitHub profile as well since I'm more of a hobbyist anyway and could
care less for proprietary Git vendors like Microsoft.
</p>

<p>
GitLab is tempting, but it looks like you'd still have to pay to 
have a free public hosting repository, so I'd rather just host it
on my own site anyway.
</p>

<p>
On the topic of trying out new Linux OS's, I've also thought more
and more about it, and I think I'll settle for trying out Slackware 
on the spare partition I have on my Desktop machine instead of Gentoo.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to save Gentoo as more of a challenge later on if I get more
comfortable using Arch on my Desktop machine.
</p>

<p>
Currently, my Arch install is broken even though I literally only
played a few Steam games on it. Not sure what the deal is with that.
However, it is a cool thrill to really have a successful installation
of Arch so that's fun in itself and a challenge completed for me.
</p>

<p>
I really really really like everything Gentoo stands for, but it looks
like you have to compile most things to keep the system up to date, which
sounds cool at first, but if its basic system level updates, that sounds
like a pain to be completely honest, so I think I might save it for a
rainy day to try installing it in a VM.
</p>

<p>
In terms of Bible reading, I've gotten to 1 Samuel - 26:1 so far. 
I've learned a lot, especially from someone as brave as David to have been
chased by his own king (Saul) to his death, and has strengthened by faith 
a bit more. It really goes to show you that people in older times had it a lot
harder, and we should be thankful we don't have to necessarily deal
with war on a daily basis. I for one am still thankful for my fiannce,
my family, the fact that I have food and shelter, and still have a job
in these dark times.
</p>

<p>
I have a few goals for this week, and they include the following (which
utilizes a cool few tricks I learned via Emacs's Org-Mode's Checklist
option):
</p>

<p>

I learned a lot with w3m in the past few days but more so today,
since I've been able to utilize a few macros from the YouTuber,
gotbletu's videos on the topic.
</p>

<p>
Here's gotbletu's related video on the topic of advanced macros in
w3m browser:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL73xWsaJP8&amp;list=PLqv94xWU9zZ35Yv0s6zMID5JoS8qu19Kh&amp;index=10">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL73xWsaJP8&amp;list=PLqv94xWU9zZ35Yv0s6zMID5JoS8qu19Kh&amp;index=10</a>
</p>

<p>
Here are some example commands that I added to my 'keymap' file
in my ~/.w3m/ directory so that I can easily do some w3m commands
with ease, the last of which I came up on my own to toggle the 
'color' command in w3m to allow for color to be displayed on a
page:
</p>

<p>
keymap  \\\t    COMMAND       "SET<sub>OPTION</sub> display<sub>borders</sub>=toggle ; RESHAPE"
keymap  \\\i    COMMAND       "SET<sub>OPTION</sub> display<sub>image</sub>=toggle ; RELOAD"
keymap  \\\e    COMMAND       "SET<sub>OPTION</sub> user<sub>agent</sub>='' ; RELOAD"
keymap  \\\a    COMMAND       "SET<sub>OPTION</sub> user<sub>agent</sub>='Opera/9.80 (S60; SymbOS; Opera Mobi/SYB-1107071606; U; en) Presto/2.8.149 Version/11.10' ; RELOAD"
keymap	\\\c COMMAND	      "SET<sub>OPTION</sub> color=toggle ; RELOAD"

Over the past few days, I figured out how to use YouTube without
using YouTube, which has been the coolest and best breakthrough
ever.
</p>

<p>
Enter Indivio.us:
"<a href="https://invidio.us/">https://invidio.us/</a>"
</p>

<p>
It's basically a website which you can run with a JavaScript-less 
browser like w3m which allows you to search YouTube without ever 
be thrown a targeted ad, nor be given any mention of any forced
suggested videos.
</p>

<p>
What you can do is to literally pipe the link you're currently on,
and then output it to mpv on a separate shell window.
</p>

<p>
This basically allows you to stream any YouTube video you want 
with mpv, again WITHOUT USING YOUTUBE.
</p>

<p>
This is totally awesome, and just helps overall as YouTube has been
crazy with too much targeted content lately.
</p>

<p>
I'm just the kind of person who wants to be on their site for Linux
info, music, and that's about it. Other than that, could care less
about any other content period.
</p>

<p>
That being said, give it a shot. There's a really good video
by the YouTube user, 'gotbletu', that goes over how to add links
to Linux clipboard in 'w3m' which I highly recommend.
</p>

<p>
Here's the video from 'gotbletu' on w3m external commands:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzgCgarUa_M&amp;list=PLqv94xWU9zZ35Yv0s6zMID5JoS8qu19Kh&amp;index=5">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzgCgarUa_M&amp;list=PLqv94xWU9zZ35Yv0s6zMID5JoS8qu19Kh&amp;index=5</a>
</p>

<p>
I now have remapped the "EXTERN" function in w3m to be the 'e' key,
and also remapped the "EXTERN<sub>LINK</sub>" function in w3m to be the 'f' key.
</p>

<p>
Combined with the two separate macros from the video from 'gotbletu',
I can easily copy the current URL link (EXTERN) to the clipboard
OR the one I'm hovering over (EXTERN<sub>LINK</sub>), so that I can pipe
it into mpv to stream YouTube videos without ever involving YouTube.
</p>

<p>
Here are my current modifications to the 'keymap' file in ~/.w3m:
<code>code</code>
########################
## CUSTOM KEYBINDINGS ##
########################
</p>

<p>
keymap e EXTERN
</p>

<p>
keymap f EXTERN<sub>LINK</sub>
<code>code</code>
</p>

<p>
Also, you can still output your YouTube Subscriptions into an OPML
XML file to be imported by an RSS feed reader like Newsboat here:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/subscription_manager/">https://www.youtube.com/subscription_manager/</a>
</p>

<p>
It took a while as it seems YouTube hid this feature, but alas
I found it, and was super happy I did.
</p>

<p>
You can basically download this file, and 'cd' to your Downloads 
directory, and run the following command to import it into Newsboat:
newsboat -i (name of file)
</p>

<p>
Also, here is the more example of a YouTube based OPML XML link as 
well for a given YouTube channel which exposes some possibilities 
for cool scripting possibilities as you can add any of the XML tags
as '&amp;' parameters for the URL itself:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC2eYFnH61tmytImy1mTYvhA">https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC2eYFnH61tmytImy1mTYvhA</a>
</p>

<p>
Example:
From that example above, you can see the "&lt;yt:channelId&gt;" tag present.
</p>

<p>
This means that you can add the 'channel<sub>id</sub>' as a parameter to the base
URL pattern:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml">https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml</a>?
</p>

<p>
BECOMES:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC2eYFnH61tmytImy1mTYvhA">https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC2eYFnH61tmytImy1mTYvhA</a>
</p>

<p>
This allows you to specifically look throughout a YouTube user's videos,
and would allow you to create a OPML file yourself for YouTube if you needed 
to.
</p>

<p>
The More You Know :)
</p>

<p>
Also, I totally want to learn 'pywal' which allows you to change your 
terminal's color scheme based on your current wallpaper background:
<a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal">https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal</a>
</p>

<p>
Plus, I installed 'qtox' so that I can get into video chats as well,
so I'm pretty stoked about that as well.
</p>

<p>
More stuff to learn this week ^_^

I was able to modify my Newsboat configuration so that I could use a 
macro to open up YouTube videos with "',' (Comma) + m" which opens
up the video in MPV.
</p>

<p>
I also made a revision to do the same action but instead be able
to open up the same article in Firefox with "',' (Comma) + f" as
well.
</p>

<p>
How this macro basically works:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It utilizes the "macro" key to set a macro in w3m.</li>
<li>It then uses 'set browser' to change the browser to the</li>
</ol>
<p>
desired program, which in this case is 'mpv' or 'firefox' respectively.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It then calls the 'open-in-browser' command to open up the article</li>
</ol>
<p>
(or YouTube video link in this case) in the desired program.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It then sets my default 'browser' environment variable in Newsboat</li>
</ol>
<p>
back to w3m, as this is my desired default browser.
</p>

<p>
This means you can literally look at YouTube videos from the accounts
you're subscribed to via RSS, and not even be on YouTube to view a
single video.
</p>

<p>
This means you can access YouTube content without ads or any other
unrelated content, which is super awesome.
</p>

<p>
Here's where you can find my current Newsboat config:
<a href="https://github.com/SBanya/dotfiles/tree/master/newsboat">https://github.com/SBanya/dotfiles/tree/master/newsboat</a>
</p>

<p>
Here are the modifications I made to my "config" file in my
~/.newsboat directory:
</p>

<p>
macro m set browser "/usr/bin/mpv %u"; open-in-browser ; set browser "/usr/bin/w3m %u"
</p>

<p>
macro f set browser "/usr/bin/firefox %u"; open-in-browser ; set browser "/usr/bin/w3m %u"

I started work on a new Selenium based Python script project as I find 
it pretty frustrating how YouTube has elminated the ability to export 
your Subscriptions as an OPML file anymore.
</p>

<p>
I believe they are doing this purely for the fact that there's YouTube
Premium now, and they want to squeeze as much ad revenue as possible
by forcing people onto their site to view content.
</p>

<p>
However, the lack of being able to export your Subscription feed into an OPML
XML file  doesn't help anyone at all who accesses their site via Screen Readers 
who happen to use (ex: blind people who can't see video content but want to 
keep up with the audio versions of their Subscription content on YouTube purely 
on text based titles for videos).
</p>

<p>
This project aims to solve this issue by logging into a user's YouTube account
via Selenium with Python bindings + the Firefox web driver so that the user
can rip the list of the YouTube channels into a list to then later provide to
a RSS reader (ex: Newsboat, etc):
<a href="https://github.com/SBanya/YoutubeSubscriptionList/">https://github.com/SBanya/YoutubeSubscriptionList/</a>
</p>

<p>
I'm not finished with it by any means yet, but am getting close but I'm 
running into a few issues with the Selenium driver itself as I had to 
obtain the latest Gecko driver here, and had to un-tar it to a specific 
location on my harddrive:
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases">https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases</a>
</p>

<p>
I also learned how to use w3m more efficiently, especially with a lot
of the options enabled within the 'o' menu to quickly refer to each
line with 'g' + line number.
</p>

<p>
I also learned how to use w3mman which is a way to put a man page within
w3m which is useful since most man pages have external links at the bottom
for documentation references.
</p>

<p>
Using w3m alone is pretty sweet.
</p>

<p>
However, I would love to have my entire Tmux session to be based from Newsboat
with w3m and other CLI utilities, so its been fun incorporating these tools
into a terminal only workflow.

I've had a pretty easy going week at work this week, which led me to finish a
lot of work projects in the next few weeks ahead of time in terms of a week
off of vacation.
</p>

<p>
That being noted, I've also made strides to really see if I can attempt to 
tap into ZenDesk. I've come across a few barriers including the fact that
I don't have access to the ZenDesk API for work. However, I'm working
around this by utilizing Selenium with Python 3 in an effort to convert
a list of tickets and import them into an Org mode document so that I would
automatically have a todo list of recently updated tickets.
</p>

<p>
This would help my workflow, and might help others in my situation in which
the API access is limited to someone's ZenDesk account. Also, I use Org-Mode
quite a lot with TODO lists at work, so incorporating the current status
of tickets into my workflow would be awesome. Even possibly having the ability
to respond to tickets without even having to log into ZenDesk sounds awesome.
I can probably achieve this with Selenium through either ZenDesk or my work
email, so either of these two solutions will help me achieve my goal in that
regards.
</p>

<p>
I have been learning more about the w3m browser, which is a super cool terminal
based web browser. Using it with the w3m-img add-on is a must though as this 
allows you to display images while surfing the web in your terminal.
</p>

<p>
I also recommend using a terminal like urxvt or x-term which supports w3m-img.
</p>

<p>
More info. on w3m can be found here:

I've been playing quite a few ZX Spectrum games, and got X128, a DOS based
pemulator for the ZX Spectrum to work just fine. However, I can't seem to
figure out why mapping keys is so hard for that emulator. I also installed
the FUSE emulator through apt so we'll see if that's better in the long run.

I worked on using the "SC-IM" program to manage my yearly finances and expenses.
</p>

<p>
"sc-im" which stands for "sc-improved" which is basically a spreadsheet program 
that utilizes Vim bindings:
<a href="https://github.com/andmarti1424/sc-im">https://github.com/andmarti1424/sc-im</a>
</p>

<p>
Two really good videos on how to use "sc-im" which I have found to be super
useful include:
</p>

<p>
Luke Smith's video on SC-IM:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_8_gazN7h0&amp;t=19s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_8_gazN7h0&amp;t=19s</a>
</p>

<p>
gotbletu's video on "sc", which is the predecessor to "SC-IM" which covers
some of the formula usage in "sc" which is pretty neat and not necessarily
too intuitive in the man page for "sc-im":
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrX2isHDQu8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrX2isHDQu8</a>
</p>

<p>
With this knowledge, I've been able to make a master spreadsheet containing
my finances for the year.
</p>

<p>
It took A LOT of manipulation from both the credit card and checking account
based .csv's, but hey, it can be done.
</p>

<p>
It's pretty neat because by doing this, you can take charge of your finances
and determine how much you're spending month to month.

Once you have formatted both the credit card and checking account .csvs to the
desired column formats, you can utilize the 'cat' Linux command to combine
them and re-direct them to a single file.
</p>

<p>
For example, this command would take the credit card .csv and checking
account .csv files and combine them into one master .csv file:
</p>

<p>
cat creditCard.csv checkingAccount.csv &gt;&gt; masterFile.csv
</p>

<p>
I keep it simple however, so its not as granular as something like a 
Credit Card statement that breaks down "food" vs "expenses", etc.
</p>

<p>
However, I have the description fields intact within its own designated column, 
so I can check out line items if I want to for specific expenses.

To help anyone else who might be utilizing a Wells Fargo bank account,
I created a webscraper with the Firefox Selenium webdriver.
</p>

<p>
You will need to have "pip3" installed Selenium, as well as "getpass" Python 3
libraries to utilize this Python 3 based webscraper script.
</p>

<p>
It aims to obtain the user's latest balance to copy it into a file of the
user's choosing, or onto the clipboard (still deciding what would be the best
for my particular workflow since I currently just need it to insert into a 
related .csv file, but most Linux users would probably want to just add it to
their clipboard using x-clip).
</p>

repository:
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/stable/games/bsdgames">https://packages.debian.org/stable/games/bsdgames</a>

<p>
Also, I checked out a few things from this cool older terminal program
based blog:
<a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/">https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/</a>
</p>

<p>
I highly recommend this blog if you're getting into minimalistic
terminal program software since a few things stand out as cool ideas
to add to a computer workflow for the newer or medium level Linux
user.
</p>

<p>
Debating what DOS games to play this weekend, and also I would like
to un-break my Arch install on the desktop computer that I have
Steam on since I'd like to keep messing around with it to see
what games Linux can run with purely Steam, and also might
try to load a few emulators on that same OS as well.
</p>

<p>
Also debating whether or not to put Gentoo on the other half
of the same drive, since I really really really like their 
philosophy and take on free software (free as in "freedom").

My best advice for these days is to pretty much keep the motto, "God's will".
</p>

<p>
That's been helping me a lot mentally in these times.

<p>
Living for today, and enjoy the blessings that you have each day.

I am happy to note that I have successfully created the Scripture Of The Day project.

<p>
It is updated daily via a cronjob.
</p>

<p>
Very happy to have been able to complete this successfully.
</p>

<p>
Looking forward to continuing progress in my other project, "OutlookTerminalClient",
as I wanted to make a project to easily display current emails from Outlook.
</p>

<p>
After that, I will continue to explore other programs that morph Python 3 
and JS based web frameworks to create interested web applications.
</p>

<p>
Also, I want to explore more terminal based applications to minmize the 
amount of bloat on my system.
</p>

<p>
I am also debating what should be my long-term email application to use, and
am debating between the following options:

I forgot to post this the other day, but I did make one final album for my 
Shibes band here:
<a href="https://shibes.bandcamp.com/album/perspectives">https://shibes.bandcamp.com/album/perspectives</a>
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, with all my attempts to re-arrange my Linux harddrives the other
weekend, I actually erased the contents of the entire album, so I only have 
the final exported music files as remnants of those sessions. This is fine
since I'm more of a person that just prefers to get stuff out there, then
to dwell on stuff and never release anything.
</p>

<p>
However, this does mean I can never re-master that album, but that's okay.
</p>

<p>
I'm kind of done with that band as it represents a certain era of my life
that I'd kind of like to leave behind a bit. I'm aiming to be more positive
despite the crazy times we're living in, and dwelling on negatives isn't really
my vibe anymore, even if it was partly for slight joke vibes.
</p>

<p>
I plan on making music going forward, but moreso, probably theme type music
with tools like MuseScore.
</p>

<p>
I would like to learn more songs on keyboard, mostly game themes, and also
a few harder songs as well.
</p>

<p>
I plan on also learning Ardour after maybe caving into the $35 license fee.
</p>

<p>
Another thing I've been working on is utilizing more terminal based programs.
</p>

<p>
One such program is "sc-im" which is a Vim based terminal spreadsheet program:
<a href="https://github.com/andmarti1424/sc-im">https://github.com/andmarti1424/sc-im</a>
</p>

<p>
Very cool so far.
</p>

<p>
Also, I plan on checking out way more terminal based programs from this 
discontinued blog to add them to my array of tools to use:
<a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/">https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/</a>
</p>

<p>
I'm currently debating either Slackware or Gentoo for a purely terminal based
distribution on a spare portion of my other harddrive as well on the desktop
computer, which is going to be fun. I don't mind window managers with some
GUI applications, but less bloat always leads to more productivity so I'm
all for it.

<p>
I'm glad that I now have access to my own website again so I can freely post
as I please again.
</p>

<p>
Clearly, the world has changed quite a bit in the last few months.
</p>

<p>
To stay positive, I've been re-affirming my Christian faith, so that's been a focus 
of mine.
</p>

<p>
I've been reading through the Bible with the help of 'KJV', which is a really
neat terminal based Bible program:
<a href="https://github.com/bontibon/kjv">https://github.com/bontibon/kjv</a>
</p>

<p>
A really cool quote amidst these crazy times that's pretty inspiring is 
from The Lord Of The Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring from J.R.R. Tolkien.
</p>

<p>
To give a synopsis, Frodo and Gandalf are discussing the complications involving
the ring he received from Bilbo, and the very real possibility that he will be 
hunted by Sauron for having the ring in the first place.
</p>

<p>
Here is the quoted conversation from Frodo and Gandalf from the book:
</p>

<p>
<i>“I wish it need not have happened in my time," said Frodo.</i>
<i>"So do I," said Gandalf, "and so do all who live to see such times. But that</i>
<i>is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time</i>
<i>that is given us.”</i>
</p>

<p>
With that in mind, time is pretty precious to someone like me with a full time job.
</p>

<p>
As a result, I've used Emacs Org-Mode for my actual job and my own personal life
to manage how much time I've spent on tasks, and on skills.
</p>

<p>
It's really helped me a lot, so I whole-heartedly recommend giving Emacs and 
Org-Mode a try if you never considered adding "TODO" lists in your daily routine.
</p>

<p>
Links:
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/</a>
<a href="https://orgmode.org/">https://orgmode.org/</a>
</p>

<p>
Also, I've been reading up on possibly growing my own food as well in case
I'd like a self-sustainable house later on in my life. That being said,
homesteading looks like a cool hobby on the side.
</p>

<p>
To stay positive amidst these times, I have re-vamped my current Linux computer
setups, and have re-done several of my computers to try out a few things.
</p>

<p>
I am currently running Debian minimal installation on both computers, and have
been trying out Arch Linux along with Steam to get some games working without
ever needing Windows 10.
</p>

<p>
Pretty sweet so far, and am loving it.
</p>

<p>
I learned a lot, but let's just say the Arch install was pretty dang hard.
</p>

<p>
And to say the least, I totally wiped out my one hard-drive by accident
as a result. Let's just say that even if you accidentally delete a harddrive's
partition, doesn't mean you should use the "dd" command to wipe the harddrive
afterwards since you can easily just re-create the partitions afterwards. 
</p>

<p>
I learned this lesson the hard way.
</p>

<p>
I plan on picking another Linux distro to run on the same drive but 
with purely terminal based apps without ever using XOrg.
</p>

<p>
I also have been trying to get in touch with the "Xiphos" team, which helps
maintain this cool bible study program, but haven't really heard back from
them in their mailing list, so I might have to keep searching for open
source projects to possibly contribute to.
</p>

<p>
My current Linux based goals include:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Learn Ledger or other CLI tools to monitor finances with .csvs from bank statements</li>
<li>Possibly learn sc-vim instead of Ledger, since it might be easier with just a master .csv file for all finances</li>
</ul>

<p>
My current programming goals:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Continue to learn web development through the Udemy course</li>
<li>Make Node.JS apps that blend with Python 3 as well</li>
<li>Keep looking for Christian faith based open source projects to contribute to</li>
</ul>

<p>
My current pet programming projects include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Goal: Generates a random King James Version of the Bible</li>
<li>scripture of the day, and displays it on a webpage by using the 'KJV'</li>
<li>command line utility.</li>
<li>Link:</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/SBanya/ScriptureOfTheDay">https://github.com/SBanya/ScriptureOfTheDay</a></li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Goal: This project aims to be a simpler approach to</li>
<li>read emails from an MS Outlook email account directly from your Linux terminal!</li>
<li>Link:</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/SBanya/OutlookTerminalClient">https://github.com/SBanya/OutlookTerminalClient</a></li>

Overall, I hope everyone is safe, and wish the best. God bless.

Here's a pretty useful command if you'd like to search for programs on the command 
line within a Debian based Linux distro:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">apt-cache search <span style="color: #4f97d7;">(</span>pattern or name of program you<span style="color: #2d9574;">'re interested in): This allows you to search for programs on the command line to install.</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Here's an example of how to apply this idea in action. In this example, let's search 
for some terminal emulator programs on Debian's apt package manager by simply providing 
"terminal emulator" as the pattern:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">apt-cache search terminal emulator
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Here's a screenshot of Sakura terminal with tmux running that command:
&lt;img id="IxAptSearchTerminalScreenshot" src="images/aptsearchterminalscreenshot.png"/&gt;
</p>

<p>
As you can see, this is pretty powerful, especially if you know a few things about pattern matching
with grep commands. Try using this idea to try some new programs out!

I finally got the Gifs page to work with the necessary file permissions, so
go check it out. These are the gifs I've made for the past few years using
a few apps on an old Samsung Galaxy S6 phone I've had. Definitely would like
to continue making art in this style with the use of the program, GIMP, alongside
some scripts to help automate it as creating gifs can be a tedious but fun process.

In case you ever need to indent an entire webpage (just like this one!) in Emacs,
you can actually select all of the code present with:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">C-x-f <span style="color: #4f97d7;">(</span>Ctrl+x+f<span style="color: #4f97d7;">)</span>: This allows you to select all lines of code present in a file.
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You can then finally then indent everything with:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">C-M-\ <span style="color: #4f97d7;">(</span>Ctrl + Alt + \ '<span style="color: #a45bad;">backslash</span>'<span style="color: #4f97d7;">)</span>: This indents all lines of code accordingly.
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I found out this trick the other day, and it helped so much especially on a site like this
when I use multiple programming languages like Python 3 vs. JS vs HTML+CSS. By letting Emacs
do the work to beautify the code, it makes the process of creating projects that much easier.

I am planning to do a re-design in early 2020 for this site to be more minimalistic
in design as I think the style attempt is good, but it could be a bit simpler, and
be based on more templated designs. I'll figure out how to do this using either
purely templates, or purely JS.

<li>Display a webpage to the user to prompt them to ask what genre or geographical state they'd be interested in terms of exploring bands from via a related email.</li>
<li>Provide the user with the email at 6 AM every day to make the program static and not dependent on being a web app.</li>
<li>Provide the user with the ability to opt out of an email every time.</li>
<li>Limit messages per email to about 10 to prevent spam.</li>
<li>Provide a user with a script that uses Youtube-dl Linux utility that automatically downloads these Bandcamp music for users.</li>

I have finished the Express Or Local App, which is a Python 3 based webscraper runs
on a non-stop cron job that pulls MTA 7 Train data and displays it in a nice and
easy to read HTML table. I'm glad this project has been finished as it has taken
quite a long time to pull off. I've been in the process of making sure my older
webscraper projects are working, and have fixed the Hockey Webscraper to make sure
it runs daily. Once my projects are back and running, I'm planning to start the
Bandcamper Python 3 based project, which is just a daily emailing agent that will
email someone their top 5 bands of the day from Bandcamp based on genre or
geographical locations they entered via a web request form (and of course they can
opt out of it at any time).

Unfortunately, I'm still paying quite a bit of medical bills as a result of that
stomach surgery (insurance is a joke) and need to spend on a car soon, so I won't be
able to do any maker projects (CNC engraving, synth creation, etc) any time soon but
I still am thinking of some cooler projects down the line to do. I am also thinking to
possibly review music gear as well as there's a bit of niche territory that's covered
by bedroom musicians like myself that aren't really represented on the Internet. I'm
also looking forward to making more headway through the "Complete Web Developer Bootcamp"
Udemy course I've been slowly working through just so I can improve this site and make
better web apps overall. I've kind of realized I still like help-desk type work,
and honestly don't care if I end up fully as a developer after all as I've had
a lot of fun with these pet projects anyway. Honestly, its what you make out of life,
and even with a career, a job is just a job at the end of the day. I think its only
when I'll be able to get my side music based instrument business going is when
I'll truly be able to push myself for the goals I've wanted to achieve.
</p>

<p>
I'm also making progress of making new music too, and the keyboard skills have been
coming along quite nicely. I'm also debating a complete design overhaul for this site
in 2020 to include a way more simpler layout, and washed out colors. Should be fun.

I have been healing after a major stomach surgery about a month ago, but have been
doing very well in terms of progress. As a test for myself, I put myself up to

You can see the related results on the Jumbotron element at the top of my web page, 
since all my projects are now updated with their latest commit dates and links. 
This single change is a vast improvement since it makes anyone including future job 
recruiters more aware of the exact changes I've made to my personal projects, as 
well as specific code examples if needed. One of a technical job recruiter's first 
questions is always, "What's your GitHub?". Well, now I can just point them to my 
web page instead :)

I've also moved away from NYC, and have had a great time so far. I honestly don't
miss it since I definitely have spent my time in New York, and would rather
return as a tourist for fun whenever I'd like to. I'm looking forward to doing 
more art projects in terms of lithography, and will actually expand this site to
showcase my previous digital art as well since this is my own site after all,
and would rather showcase them here than on other platforms. I am also debating 
how best to make synth projects while in an apartment, and am also debating
building a mini-Arduino based CNC in the future.

I am now updating this website with the power of 'rsync', which is a Linux command line utility
that I use to automatically sync the changes from my local computer (laptop) to the Digital
Ocean droplet that hosts this site. I have also set this to be done on a Crontab job, meaning that
if I ever feel like updating this website, I can do so at my own pace, and it will be automatically
be updated every 5 minutes. This was also made possible with the idea of using a 'symlink', which
is in the same vein as using a shortcut, but between two file locations in Linux. Here's one
link to learn about 'rsync':
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Here's another  to learn about 'symlink' or the 'ln' command in case you're interested:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1951742/how-to-symlink-a-file-in-linux">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1951742/how-to-symlink-a-file-in-linux</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
A special thank you goes out to people from the #linux channel on IRC that helped me through this
process since it was a bit difficult to wrap my head around the process of finally using 'rsync'
after days of getting so many permission errors.
</p>

<p>
The specific command in case you would like to use it on your site is as follows, NOTE: I have used
parentheses where YOU need to enter in values:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">rsync -e <span style="color: #2d9574;">'ssh'</span> -avzp <span style="color: #4f97d7;">(</span>path/to/public_html/on/local/machine/with/ending/slash/<span style="color: #4f97d7;">)</span>
user@<span style="color: #4f97d7;">(</span>ip address for remote server<span style="color: #4f97d7;">)</span>:/path/to/directory/on/website/machine/with/slash/at/end/
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Here's an even more specific example with fake ip address values for context:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">rsync -e <span style="color: #2d9574;">'ssh'</span> -avzp /home/user/public_html/ user@555.55.555.5:/home/user/public_html/
</pre>
</div>

<p>
One more thing to keep in mind is that you will need to create a symlink between the actual directory
that's necessary to host the website on Apache. For me, this was in <i>var/www/musimatic.net/public<sub>html</sub></i>
You will need to create symlink with the "ln" command to create a "link" or "shortcut" to the
home directory that's easily accessible to any user who has SSH access to the machine hosting your
website. This part of the process is done so that rsync can do its syncing ability without having
to worry about needing any root access.

The Creators of SQL:
Donald D. Chamberlin, and Raymond F. Boyce designed SQL while working at IBM to manipulate 
and retrieve data that was stored in IBM's original sudo-relational database management system, 
System R, which was developed at IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory in the 1970s.
</p>

<p>
Reasons To Use SQL:
SQL (Structured Query Language) allows you to easily query databases for use in your 
data projects.
</p>

<p>
Though there are many variants on DBMS (Database Management System), knowing the basics 
can allow you to interact with databases regardless of what software you eventually use.
</p>

<p>
Being able to manipulate queries results in far more powerful results than simply using
Excel filters on a dataset in a spreadsheet.
</p>

<p>
The Basics Of SQL:
I've been learning SQL as a result of my job, but also on the side as well to include
databases for the fun side projects I have. As a result, I've been able to get a bit
more familiar with the basics of how SQL works, so I'd love to impart some of the basics
in this post.
How To Use Sqlite3 In Linux Bash Shell
</p>

<p>
Starting Sqlite3 Using An Existing Database
Here's the basic syntax on how to open up any Sqlite database using the Linux Bash Shell.
First, start up a terminal in your Linux OS, and run the following command after 
installing Sqlite3 to open up an any database you'd like. The syntax is: sqlite3 (name of database).
</p>

<p>
Here's an example:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sql">sqlite3 example.db
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Running A .sql Script After Loading A SQL Database
Now that we've gotten the database loaded, use the '.read' command to open up any SQL script
that you currently have present in the same directory. For example, I'm going to load
an example script called 'example.sql':
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sql">.<span style="color: #4f97d7; font-weight: bold;">read</span> example.<span style="color: #4f97d7; font-weight: bold;">sql</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Your First SQL Select Query
Now that we've discussed how to open up Sqlite3 with the Bash shell, let's put this to good use
by creating our first query. In this example, I am using the Sqlite database provided by the book,
"SamsTeachYourself SQL in 10 Minutes", which can be found here:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://forta.com/wp-content/uploads/books/0672336073/TeachYourselfSQL_SQLite.zip">https://forta.com/wp-content/uploads/books/0672336073/TeachYourselfSQL_SQLite.zip</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Let's begin by opening up the 'tysql.sqlite' database on the Linux Bash Shell in Sqlite3, and then 
query it directly:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sql">sqlite3 tysql.<span style="color: #4f97d7; font-weight: bold;">sql</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now, let's use the 'SELECT' keyword to 'select' some of the data present.
More specifically, let's just select all of the data present by using the '*' or 'Wildcard'
character in order to select all of it with the following SQL statement.
Also, we need to specify what table it is from using the 'FROM' keyword, which we'll
make sure to tell SQL to grab data from the 'Products' table.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sql"><span style="color: #4f97d7; font-weight: bold;">SELECT</span> * <span style="color: #4f97d7; font-weight: bold;">FROM</span> Products;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Our result would look like the following:
&lt;img width="85%" height="100%" src="images/SelectStatementResult.jpg"/&gt;
</p>

<p>
Voilah! You now know how to do the most basic SQL select statement of all using the '*'
wildcard character.
</p>

A Brief History Of The Emacs Text Editor
</p>

<p>
Richard Stallman created Emacs in late 1976 after combining the MIT lab 'E' text editor, with
a set of macros to make the text editor easier to use.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
</p>

<p>
The Basics Of Emacs:
I have begun to learn the text editor, Emacs, with the use of their in-built tutorials.
I have always liked Vim, but would like to learn both in case it become useful later for
a future Dev or Dev Ops role. If there's something I've liked so far is the capability of 
using multiple buffers, as well as the idea to use multiple plugins to treat Emacs truly as 
an all-in-one OS-like application.
</p>

<p>
Useful Beginner Emacs Shortcuts:
</p>

<p>
Moving Around In Emacs:

Ctrl + l: Clear The Screen, And Redisplay The Text <span style="color: #4f97d7;">(</span>Center, Bottom, Top<span style="color: #4f97d7;">)</span>
Ctrl + n: Next Line
Ctrl + p: Previous Line
Ctrl + f: Forward One Character
Ctrl + b: Previous One Character
Meta + f: Forward One Word
Meta + b: Backward One Word
</pre>

Digital Ocean Now Hosts This Site: 
I've recently shifted this website to now be hosted on DigitalOcean droplet, which means that I
now have total freedom of what gets installed on the backend of the site, and can actively support
my existing projects with cooler Linux functionalities, especially with Cron jobs.
</p>

<p>
I have also been getting the hang of using SFTP to download the site and work on it remotely, 
and then reupload it when I'm done instead of having to use SSH which disconnects regularly.
Express Or Local Python Project:
I've been still working on that MTA Python based project, but re-wrote it
for the third time to instead utilize the Marshmallow Python library to create database table
schemas that end up being used by SQLAlchemyCore.
</p>

<p>
Bandcamper Python Project:
I have also been working on a Python project called Bandcamper, which aims to allow a user
to search for artists on Bandcamp in a terminal window without having to use an internet browser.
Ultimately, I want the end user to be able to stream the final results in their given music player
of choice, and also be able to download any songs they want, with whatever quality they want 
up to 320 kbps mp3. Past that, they'd have to pay the artist for their music, but this is better
than the existing comparable project on Python PyPi that only allows for a measley 128 kbps
mp3 download, which is terrible beyond words in terms of music quality.
</p>

<p>
Fake Website And JavaScript Progress:
I've been working on "Emulation Nation", which is just a fake website about emulation that I've 
been utilizing my JS skills with. I've also been doing the tutorials for Puppeter since I'm
planning on porting the webscraper I've created at work to JS with Puppeter for a more
responsive webpage experience.

I've also decided to get this only working for the 7 Train since Amazon announced its 2nd HQ as Long Island

Bull or Bear Webscraper is having issues since I was able to scrape the page using the older "WebClient" C#

I have made more changes regarding object orientated JS ideas to the Visit Monaco website, and also uploaded 
my progress for the "Express or Local App". I have been actively trying to help the Lubuntu community with 
two related bugs using C++ and qt, as well as Python.

I have been making more progress on the Express or Local Python app with the help of IRC members from the 
#Python channel. I'm getting closer to being able to parse through the unbuffered .proto protocol data 
stream from MTA, and will work with it to make it useable. I've been also implementing more object orientated 
scripts for the "Visit Monaco" website as well.

I completed the Hockey Webscraper project, and it now runs at 1 PM every day on my Twitter account. I am now 
working on an MTA related Python app called "Express Or Local" that displays express or local train time, 
and will display user configured route settings. I also have been working on adding more JavaScript scripts 
to the "Visit Monaco" website.

With the help from some programmers on the #Python IRC channel, I have been able to run the Hockey Webscraper 
successfully. The only thing remaining for this project is to add team logos as another dictionary of .jpeg 
pictures within the same directory. I have also continued to make progress in "Automate the Boring Stuff 
with Python", and also have updated the "Visit Monaco" webpage with a few more scripts in the Stats webpage. 
</p>

<p>
I have also been going back and forth on Beeware's Gitter page to get more help running the tests necessary 
for their open source project. I'm aiming to probably start learning GIT as well to help with this website.

I've been trying to figure out how to fix the "ftplib" Python module issue, and have been sending e-mails 
back and forth to the web hosting company to figure out the exact FTP directory I need to upload a link 
for the Hockey Webscraper. I've also ran a test suite for the Pybee open source project, and am going to 
run more specific tests for the project next week. I received the switches in the mail for the PODHD500 
guitar pedal, so I'll post pics of how I fix it by soldering new switches within the next two weeks 
during a weekend. I also updated the Visit Monaco website with new scripts to include object orientated 
JavaScript programming as well.

I have been updating the Monaco website to include more scripts on the stats page. I am also becoming 
more active in Open Source projects such as BeeWare, and am working on running test scripts for this 
great open source project. I am also working on finishing the Hockey Webscraper to include an FTP link 
via the Twitter post that will be hosted from the webhosting provider's FTP service via Python's "ftplib" 
module, and using urllib3. I'm also going to be fixing the switches on my Line 6 PodHD500 multi-fx pedal 
this weekend, and will post related pics of the completed project.

I've been working on the Visit Monaco website, and to update the Hockey Webscraper to be placed on 
Twitter. The only issue at the moment is to account for Python's FTP module, and with the shared hosting 
server that this website is on. Once that is included, I can finally include Twitter posts with Excel 
.xlsx file attachments for the Hockey Webscraper. I also have been working on different Automating The 
Boring Stuff chapter projects which I will upload at a later time.

I updated the Cat Of The Day Twitter Webscraper Bot to actually run at 1 pm every day! This took several 
attempts since the urllib module is very specific on how its methods are called. I am currently working on 
adding more features to the Monaco website, and am also working on making a menu webscraper Twitter bot that 
will actively scrape a Brooklyn based restaurant's PDF menu. I'm waiting for Twitter to approve this bot's 
account, but should be working soon.

I am making progress on the Hockey Webscraper, but haven't posted the results yet. I created another fake 
website called "The History Of MS Paint" to demonstrate my skills learned from Chapters 1 &amp; 2 for the HTML &amp; JS

reinforce and demonstrate what I've learned so far.

Was incredibly sick for the last two weeks, but thankfully feel much better now. I have started working in the 
programming books at work to continue my progress, and will focus on the Hockey Webscraper first before revisiting 
the Song Of The Day Webscraper, since that will take more time to really find a solution via Repl.it

Updated the Song Of The Day Webscraper with my current version. It's still not working because I haven't figured
