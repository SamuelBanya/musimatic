	<h1>How To Search For Packages In The Terminal On A Debian Based Linux Distro</h1>

	<br />
	<p class="IxPostParagraph">
	  Here's a pretty useful command if you'd like to search for programs on the command line within a
	  Debian based Linux distro:
	</p>
	<br />  
	<pre>
          <code>apt-cache search (pattern or name of program you're interested in): This allows you to search for programs on the command line to install.</code>
	</pre>
        <br />
	<p class="IxPostParagraph">
	  Here's an example of how to apply this idea in action. In this example, let's search for some
	  terminal emulator programs on Debian's apt package manager by simply providing "terminal emulator"
	  as the pattern.
	</p>
	<br />  
	<pre>
          <code>apt-cache search terminal emulator</code>
	</pre>
        <br />
	<p class="IxPostParagraph">
	  Here's a screenshot of Sakura terminal with tmux running that command:

	<br />
	<img id="IxAptSearchTerminalScreenshot" src="images/aptsearchterminalscreenshot.png"/>
	<br />
	<br />
	<p class="IxPostParagraph">
	  As you can see, this is pretty powerful, especially if you know a few things about pattern matching
	  with grep commands. Try using this idea to try some new programs out!

	<h1>Emacs Way To Indent Multiple Blocks Of Code</h1>

	<p class="IxPostParagraph">
	  In case you ever need to indent an entire webpage (just like this one!) in Emacs,
	  you can actually select all of the code present with:
	</p>
	<br />  
	<pre>
          <code>C-x-f (Ctrl+x+f): This allows you to select all lines of code present in a file.</code>
	</pre>
        <br />
	<p class="IxPostParagraph">
	  You can then finally then indent everything with:
	</p>
	<br />
	<pre>
	  <code>C-M-\ (Ctrl + Alt + \ 'backslash'): This indents all lines of code accordingly.</code>
	</pre>
	<br />
	<p class="IxPostParagraph">
	  I found out this trick the other day, and it helped so much especially on a site like this
	  when I use multiple programming languages like Python 3 vs. JS vs HTML+CSS. By letting Emacs
	  do the work to beautify the code, it makes the process of creating projects that much easier.

	  it runs daily. Once my projects are back and running, I'm planning to start the

	  also looking forward to making more headway through the "Complete Web Developer Bootcamp"
	  Udemy course I've been slowly working through just so I can improve this site and make
	  better web apps overall. I've kind of realized I still like help-desk type work,
	  and honestly don't care if I end up fully as a developer after all as I've had
	  a lot of fun with these pet projects anyway. Honestly, its what you make out of life,
	  and even with a career, a job is just a job at the end of the day. I think its only
	  when I'll be able to get my side music based instrument business going is when
	  I'll truly be able to push myself for the goals I've wanted to achieve.
	</p>
	<p class="IxPostParagraph">
	  I'm also making progress of making new music too, and the keyboard skills have been
	  coming along quite nicely. I'm also debating a complete design overhaul for this site
	  in 2020 to include a way more simpler layout, and washed out colors. Should be fun.

          I have been healing after a major stomach surgery about a month ago, but have been
	  doing very well in terms of progress. As a test for myself, I put myself up to
	  the challenge of being able to try to tap into GitHub's REST API. Just in case you
	  are wondering, "<strong>REST</strong>" stands for "<strong>RE</strong>
	  presentational<strong>S</strong>tate <strong>T</strong>ransfer", while 
	  "<strong>API</strong>" stands for "<strong>A</strong>pplication 
	  <strong>P</strong>rogramming <strong>I</strong>nterface". It is basically a way you 
	  can access a company's website's data, which in my example is act of me obtaining 
	  the company, GitHub's data relating to my GitHub user commits. 
	</p>
	<p class="IxPostParagraph">
	  In case you'd like to learn about <strong>REST API's</strong>, please check out this 
	  really good video on the topic, which is available at this

	  You can see the related results on the Jumbotron element at the top of my web page, 
	  since all my projects are now updated with their latest commit dates and links. 
	  This single change is a vast improvement since it makes anyone including future job 
	  recruiters more aware of the exact changes I've made to my personal projects, as 
	  well as specific code examples if needed. One of a technical job recruiter's first 
	  questions is always, "What's your GitHub?". Well, now I can just point them to my 
	  web page instead :)

	  I've also moved away from NYC, and have had a great time so far. I honestly don't
	  miss it since I definitely have spent my time in New York, and would rather
	  return as a tourist for fun whenever I'd like to. I'm looking forward to doing 
	  more art projects in terms of lithography, and will actually expand this site to
	  showcase my previous digital art as well since this is my own site after all,
	  and would rather showcase them here than on other platforms. I am also debating 
	  how best to make synth projects while in an apartment, and am also debating
	  building a mini-Arduino based CNC in the future.

        <br />
        <p class="IxPostParagraph">
          I am now updating this website with the power of 'rsync', which is a Linux command line utility
          that I use to automatically sync the changes from my local computer (laptop) to the Digital
          Ocean droplet that hosts this site. I have also set this to be done on a Crontab job, meaning that
          if I ever feel like updating this website, I can do so at my own pace, and it will be automatically
          be updated every 5 minutes. This was also made possible with the idea of using a 'symlink', which
          is in the same vein as using a shortcut, but between two file locations in Linux. Here's one
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">link</a> to learn about 'rsync', and here's another 
          <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1951742/how-to-symlink-a-file-in-linux">link</a> to learn 
          about 'symlink' or the 'ln' command in case you're interested.
        </p>
        <p class="IxPostParagraph">
          A special thank you goes out to people from the #linux channel on IRC that helped me through this
          process since it was a bit difficult to wrap my head around the process of finally using 'rsync'
          after days of getting so many permission errors.
        </p>
        <p class="IxPostParagraph">
          The specific command in case you would like to use it on your site is as follows, NOTE: I have used
          parentheses where YOU need to enter in values:
	</p>
        <br />
	<pre>
          <code>
	    rsync -e 'ssh' -avzp (path/to/public_html/on/local/machine/with/ending/slash/)
	    user@(ip address for remote server):/path/to/directory/on/website/machine/with/slash/at/end/
          </code>
	</pre>
        <p class="IxPostParagraph">
          Here's an even more specific example with fake ip address values for context:
	</p>
        <br />
	<pre>
          <code>
	    rsync -e 'ssh' -avzp /home/user/public_html/ user@555.55.555.5:/home/user/public_html/
	  </code>
	</pre>
        <p class="IxPostParagraph">
          One more thing to keep in mind is that you will need to create a symlink between the actual directory
          that's necessary to host the website on Apache. For me, this was in /var/www/musimatic.net/public_html/
          You will need to create symlink with the "ln" command to create a "link" or "shortcut" to the
          home directory that's easily accessible to any user who has SSH access to the machine hosting your
          website. This part of the process is done so that rsync can do its syncing ability without having
          to worry about needing any root access.

          Donald D. Chamberlin, and Raymond F. Boyce designed SQL while working at IBM to manipulate

          System R, which was developed at IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory in the 1970s.<sup>1</sup>

              SQL (Structured Query Language) allows you to easily query databases for use in your

            <li>
              Though there are many variants on DBMS (Database Management System), knowing the basics

            <li>
              Being able to manipulate queries results in far more powerful results than simply using

        <h2>How To Use Sqlite3 In Linux Bash Shell</h2>
        <br />
        <h3>Starting Sqlite3 Using An Existing Database</h3>
        <p class="IxPostParagraph">
          Here's the basic syntax on how to open up any Sqlite database using the Linux Bash Shell.
          First, start up a terminal in your Linux OS, and run the following command after 
          installing Sqlite3 to open up an any database you'd like. The syntax is: sqlite3 (name of database).
          Here's an example:
        </p>
	<pre>
          <code>sqlite3 example.db</code>
	</pre>
        <h3>Running A .sql Script After Loading A SQL Database</h3>
        <p class="IxPostParagraph">
          Now that we've gotten the database loaded, use the '.read' command to open up any SQL script
          that you currently have present in the same directory. For example, I'm going to load
          an example script called 'example.sql':
        </p>
	<pre>
          <code>.read example.sql</code>
	</pre>
        <h3>Your First SQL Select Query</h3>
        <p class="IxPostParagraph">
          Now that we've discussed how to open up Sqlite3 with the Bash shell, let's put this to good use
          by creating our first query. In this example, I am using the Sqlite database provided by the book,
          "SamsTeachYourself SQL in 10 Minutes", which can be found at <a href="https://forta.com/wp-content/uploads/books/0672336073/TeachYourselfSQL_SQLite.zip">here</a>.
          Let's begin by opening up the 'tysql.sqlite' database on the Linux Bash Shell in Sqlite3, and then 
          query it directly:
        </p>
	<pre>
          <code>sqlite3 tysql.sql</code>
	</pre>
        <p class="IxPostParagraph">
          Now, let's use the 'SELECT' keyword to 'select' some of the data present.
          More specifically, let's just select all of the data present by using the '*' or 'Wildcard'
          character in order to select all of it with the following SQL statement.
          Also, we need to specify what table it is from using the 'FROM' keyword, which we'll
          make sure to tell SQL to grab data from the 'Products' table.
        </p>
	<pre>
          <code>SELECT * FROM Products;</code>
	</pre>
        <p class="IxPostParagraph">
          Our result would look like the following:
          <br />
          <img width="85%" height="100%" src="images/SelectStatementResult.jpg"/>
          <br />
        </p>
        <p class="IxPostParagraph">
          Voilah! You now know how to do the most basic SQL select statement of all using the '*'
          wildcard character.

        <p class="IxPostParagraph">
          I've recently shifted this website to now be hosted on DigitalOcean droplet, which means that I
          now have total freedom of what gets installed on the backend of the site, and can actively support
          my existing projects with cooler Linux functionalities, especially with Cron jobs.
          I have also been getting the hang of using SFTP to download the site and work on it remotely, 
          and then reupload it when I'm done instead of having to use SSH which disconnects regularly.
        </p>
        <h3>Express Or Local Python Project</h3>
        <br />
        <br />

        <p class="IxPostParagraph">
          I've been still working on that MTA Python based project, but re-wrote it
          for the third time to instead utilize the Marshmallow Python library to create database table
          schemas that end up being used by SQLAlchemyCore.
        </p>
        <h3>Bandcamper Python Project</h3>
        <br />
        <br />
        <img class="IxLandscapeLogo" src="images/BandcampLogo.png"/>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p class="IxPostParagraph">
          I have also been working on a Python project called Bandcamper, which aims to allow a user
          to search for artists on Bandcamp in a terminal window without having to use an internet browser.
          Ultimately, I want the end user to be able to stream the final results in their given music player
          of choice, and also be able to download any songs they want, with whatever quality they want 
          up to 320 kbps mp3. Past that, they'd have to pay the artist for their music, but this is better
          than the existing comparable project on Python PyPi that only allows for a measley 128 kbps
          mp3 download, which is terrible beyond words in terms of music quality.

          I've been working on "Emulation Nation", which is just a fake website about emulation that I've 
          been utilizing my JS skills with. I've also been doing the tutorials for Puppeter since I'm
          planning on porting the webscraper I've created at work to JS with Puppeter for a more
          responsive webpage experience.

          This is the Welcome Center I have been developing for the past several months with the use of C++,

          Thankfully, it is now a fully functional one window application that is meant to help guide a 
          new user of Lubuntu of what to do after installing the operating system. 
        </p> 
        <h3>Features of the Welcome Center</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Open The Lubuntu Manual Webpage</li>
          <li>Configure Monitor Settings (Resolution)</li>
          <li>Open LXQt Configuration Center To Further Adjust Entire OS Setup</li>
          <li>Open Lubuntu Community Links Webpage To Get Help Through IRC, Telegram, And Mailing Lists</li>

        <p class="IxPostParagraph">
          I have begun the new year with quite a few changes to note. I was unfortunately sick for the 
          last two weeks, but began an awesome new job doing customer support for a software firm. 
          I plan on sharing my adventures in learning automation tools like Selenium, and PowerShell, 
          in order to automate some of the boring or repetitive tasks regarding customer tickets in
          ZenDesk, and JIRA.
        </p>
        <p class="IxPostParagraph"> 
          I finally have the Hockey Webscraper up and running after getting the FTP side of things 
          resolved with the web hosting site and am trying my best to still work on finishing the 
          MTA based Express or Local App. I also worked on the Jim Davis based
          fan website as well.
        </p>
        <p class="IxPostParagraph">
          I am actively working on improving the overall feel of this webpage to be more like WordPress 
          in design, but still am adamant on using my own CSS styling, alongside Bootstrap.
        </p>
        <p class="IxPostParagraph">
          I will use this site as an educational tool in articles that I will call "SuperUser Sam" in 
          which I write about programming, automation, Linux utilities, Raspberry Pi, etc. I am really 
          looking forward to this, and hope you will join me in my love to make everyone's lives a 
          little bit easier with the use of computers.
