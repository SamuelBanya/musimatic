							<h3 class="RNDay">5-11-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">Fixed JavaScript script issue with MCHammer dislike counter, problem was within if statement block. Styling fixed, website is complete and looks great!</li>
							<h3 class="RNDay">5-10-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">Changed background-color to orange on all pages using * {}. Fix the styling issues on the Spin To Win page.</li>
							<h3 class="RNDay">5-9-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">Need to fix nextProfilePicture button's JavaScript code since it resets the dislike for MC Hammer to zero after one loop.</li>
							<h3 class="RNDay">5-8-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">Updated styling of all pages to include orange, black, and white color scheme. Needs to be cleaned up slightly and it's done.</li>
							<h3 class="RNDay">5-7-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">Added ReleaseNotes.html webpage, and updated all links. Website looks good, and functionality is consistent. I only want to change the color scheme to possibly include orange and black colors.</li>
							<h3 class="RNDay">5-4-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">Fixed display:inline issue on Profiles.html page</li>
							<h3 class="RNDay">5-3-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">Added styling to Profiles.html page. Fix display:inline issue where the net worth amount is not being printed on the same line</li>
							<h3 class="RNDay">5-2-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">Learned about "class="list-unstyled", which is a Bootstrap specific class to create unordered lists that don't have bullets. Keep fixing the styling of the Profiles.html webpage</li>				
							<h3 class="RNDay">5-1-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">Added styling to Profiles.css stylesheet, and tried to add bolder hr tags between the profiles. Try using this StackOverflow response to guide you to make them appear more bold: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4151743/how-i-change-the-thickness-of-my-hr-tag </li>		
							<h3 class="RNDay">4-30-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">Added content to Profiles.html webpage. Fix styling for webpage.</li>		
							<h3 class="RNDay">4-27-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">I added content to the Profiles.html webpage, and updated links to this page across the site. Add relevant information regarding celebrities on this page including net worth, hometown, past marriages, astrology sign, etc</li>		
							<h3 class="RNDay">4-25-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">Fixed the padding issue for the like and dislike counters by adding padding-right to the like counter div and I also added padding-left to the dislike counter div. Work on the Profile page next.</li>	
							<h3 class="RNDay">4-24-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">Added a Profile page instead of the Top Single Convicts page just to list white collar celebrities available on the website.</li>		
							<h3 class="RNDay">4-23-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">I corrected the like and dislike counters, and added appropriate STW prefixes to them for their ids. Will fix spacing between them. I thought of a idea as well to just replace the Top Single Convicts webpage with descriptions of available singles instead since most of the website features preplanned websites, and also because this doesn't have the ability to webscrape actual white collar crime convicts, and more or less focuses on funny celebrity convictions.</li>		
							<h3 class="RNDay">4-20-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">I tried adding a like counter and dislike counter variable that would change the inner HTML value of the like and dislike span tags on the SpinToWin.html webpage. However, after doing simple print statements, I see no changes in results unfortunately.</li>		
							<h3 class="RNDay">4-18-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">Added all fake websites to Musimatic.net webpage, but I thought I had to update the href attributes of all links to include the new directory. The website really only cares about the current directory downward, so it doesn't care if its placed in a folder called "Fake Websites". I fixed styling issues, and created a random button that works using Math.random() function from JavaScript.</li>		
							<h3 class="RNDay">4-17-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">I am close to adjusting the style of both the main webpage, and the Spin To Win page to match their styling. The issue was actually that Chrome decided to remember how I zoomed in the webpage. Matching the styling of both pages and fix the random image button I was working on.</li>		
							<h3 class="RNDay">4-13-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">I was able to re-think the logic behind the array based buttons in the Spin To Win webpage, and realized that the only issue was the actual assignment statement for imageIndex, since it is a good idea to make it return to the end of the array. However, computers count from 0 onward, so even though it was just 5 celebrities, you would have to go to imageArray.length - 1 to get to the final position when indexing into it. Fix the styling of the Spin To Win vs. the main index page. I want it to be uniform in terms of CSS styling.</li>		
							<h3 class="RNDay">4-12-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">The forward and back buttons now work, but the logic for the Back button still produces an "undefined value". Re-think about the array length conditions on the reverse loop. It's a great idea to reset it to the final item in the list using the array.length property, however, the logic behind the if condition is not correct. Fix this</li>		
							<h3 class="RNDay">4-10-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">Set a limit to the array looping logic for the forward and backwards buttons by adding a condition to check if its the .length - 1. This works, except the button doesn't just skip to the next person, so add some logic in regards to the loop or clicks. The name array is not changing, fix this.</li>		
							<h3 class="RNDay">4-9-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">Adjusted consistent styling to be similar on home page and Spin To Win webpage. Will work on fixing JavaScript script for Spin To Win webpage next.</li>		
							<h3 class="RNDay">4-6-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">The buttons officially work, but they ultimately lead to an "undefined" element of both the image array and quote array. Add error checking using .length() on the array itself</li>	
							<h3 class="RNDay">4-5-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">I checked the back button and its fine, though the forward and back buttons for the Spin To Win website will randomly show unloaded images. This is most likely due to the logic behind the array, so check that. I added Like and Dislike buttons, which should most likely have effects in other locations of the website.</li>		
							<h3 class="RNDay">4-4-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">Added functionality to forward button on Spin To Win page which works, but back button is not currently working. Fix this.</li>	
							<h3 class="RNDay">4-3-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">Added rounded images, and looked for square images to round out instead, which worked fine. Current problem is that the JS scripts to change the current matching profile image is not working. Fix this.</li>		
							<h3 class="RNDay">4-2-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">Improved the Spin To Win website, by adding more centering CSS styling and also included buttons for the user to cycle through available celebrity convict pictures. Goals: Add the ability to cycle through available pictures. Fix the profile pic on the SpinToWin.html page.</li>	
							<h3 class="RNDay">3-22-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">Added cycling celebrity image and quote for main webpage. 2. I plan on making the homepage more discrete and uniform as well, by crossreferencing the css class objects available from Bootstrap</li>	
							<h3 class="RNDay">3-23-2018:</h3>
							<li class="RNReleaseNote">I tried adding a rounded-circle border to images, but it's not actually showing up on the website.</li>	
							<h3 class="RNDay"></h3>
