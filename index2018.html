I also switched my focus on the Bull or Bear Webscraper C# app to try to scrape the CNBC website, and then switched the focus back to trying to utilize the Bloomberg C# API since they DO provide examples within the same download, and its worth a shot. I updated the Python and C# sections with new examples from Chapter 7 and Chapter 2 respectively.

The biggest issue I'm facing is trying to make the data only look into the 7 Train, by indexing into feed.entity with a specific value. I've been trying to just brute force it and see which value works, but I might be better off actually looking into some of the .txt files provided by the MTA. I also finished the Visit Monaco website, but am trying to fix the styling of various HTML elements throughout the pages present.</li>

						<li class="list-unstyled">I finished applying Chapter 3 of the "Javascript & JQuery" book to the "Visit Monaco" website. I plan on modifying the content by adding additional CSS styling changes next week. I only made small progress for Python and C# due to working overtime to leave early for the Thanksgiving holiday next week. The current issue with the Python based MTA Express or Local App is the looping section for each of the train properties. I've also decided to get this only working for the 7 Train since Amazon announced its 2nd HQ as Long Island City, Queens, so its only applicable to track the 7 train's data for this reason. The C# based Bloomberg Bull or Bear Webscraper is having issues since I was able to scrape the page using the older "WebClient" C# library, but Bloomberg detected my scraper. This means I'll have to access their data via an API instead, and hopefully this will be easy in C#.</li>

It's complete, and I like how it looks with Bootstrap. I tried adding a dropdown menu nav bar with Bootstrap, but this is not necessarily working out easily. Will try again next week.</li>
